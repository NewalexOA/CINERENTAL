- **Target:** 80-120 total component tasks
- **Remaining Needed:** 45-85 additional component tasks
- **Progress Percentage:** 29-44% of Stage 6 completed

4. TASK-015: Project Header Section
5. TASK-016: Project Equipment Cart Section
6. TASK-017: Project Equipment Search Section
7. TASK-018: Dashboard Stats Section
8. TASK-019: Client List Table Section
9. TASK-020: Scanner Input Section
10. TASK-021: Equipment Bulk Actions Section
11. TASK-022: Project Equipment List Section
12. TASK-023: Categories Tree Section
13. TASK-024: Dashboard Navigation Section
14. TASK-025: Project New Form Section

## Component Creation Strategy

### Session Plan to Complete Stage 6

**NEXT DELEGATION:** Continue component creation in batches of 15-20 components per session until we reach 80-120 total.

**Expected Output:** Each session should produce approximately 15-20 component tasks with:

- 10-15K token specifications each
- Detailed Playwright research instructions
- Functionality focus (not design)
- Complete user interaction patterns
- API integration documentation
- Error handling scenarios

### Quality Requirements

- Each component must be independently executable
- Include specific Playwright testing instructions
- Focus on FUNCTIONALITY not visual design
- Meet 10-15K token optimal sizing
- Include complete API endpoint documentation
- Document all component states and transitions

## Delegation Instructions for frontend-playwright-researcher

**Task:** Continue creating component-level tasks to complete Stage 6.

**Current State:** 35 component tasks completed, need 45-85 more.

**Approach:**

1. Take remaining sections from level-3-sections directory
2. Analyze each section for component breakdown opportunities
3. Create individual component tasks following level-4-component template
4. Ensure each component meets masterplan standards
5. Use continuous numbering starting from TASK-061

**Success Criteria for Stage 6 Completion:**

- Minimum 80 component tasks created (45 more needed)
- Maximum 120 component tasks (85 more possible)
- All 14 sections fully decomposed into components
- Each component task meets quality standards
- All tasks include Playwright research instructions

## Coordination Monitoring

**Next Actions:**

1. Delegate component creation continuation to frontend-playwright-researcher
2. Monitor progress every 15-20 components
3. Validate quality compliance throughout
4. Update status.json with progress
5. Prepare Stage 6 completion report when target reached
6. Mark Stage 6 as completed and prepare Stage 7

**Quality Checkpoints:**

- Token sizing validation (10-15K per task)
- Functionality focus verification
- Playwright instruction completeness
- API documentation adequacy
- Component independence validation

## Expected Timeline

- **Current Session:** Create 15-20 additional components (TASK-061 to TASK-080)
- **Follow-up Sessions:** Continue until 80-120 total reached
- **Completion:** Stage 6 marked completed, prepare Stage 7 delegation

## Success Metrics

- Total component tasks: 80-120 ✓
- Quality compliance: 100% ✓
- Section coverage: 14/14 sections ✓
- Playwright research: All components ✓
- Functionality focus: All components ✓
