# REPORT: STAGE 1 - INFRASTRUCTURE SETUP

**Agent:** architect
**Date:** 2025-09-11 15:03:00
**Execution Time:** 5 minutes

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Task 1: Created complete directory structure according to masterplan specifications
- ✅ Task 2: Verified and confirmed 5 specification templates with mandatory Playwright research instructions
- ✅ Task 3: Created 3 missing JSON schemas (section-schema.json, component-schema.json, api-schema.json)
- ✅ Task 4: Updated progress tracking file (progress/status.json)
- ✅ Task 5: Created and validated template example (TASK-EXAMPLE-search-input.md)
- ✅ Task 6: Updated status to mark STAGE-1 as completed and STAGE-2 as pending

## Created Files

- `/Users/anaskin/Github/CINERENTAL/frontend_description/results/schemas/section-schema.json` - JSON schema for Level 3 section analysis
- `/Users/anaskin/Github/CINERENTAL/frontend_description/results/schemas/component-schema.json` - JSON schema for Level 4 component analysis
- `/Users/anaskin/Github/CINERENTAL/frontend_description/results/schemas/api-schema.json` - JSON schema for Level 5 API integration analysis
- `/Users/anaskin/Github/CINERENTAL/frontend_description/tasks/level-4-components/TASK-EXAMPLE-search-input.md` - Template validation example
- `/Users/anaskin/Github/CINERENTAL/frontend_description/progress/stage-1-report.md` - This completion report

## Success Criteria Validation

- ✅ All folders created according to masterplan specification
- ✅ 5 specification templates exist with "Playwright research" sections and detailed instructions
- ✅ Templates contain clear boundaries "WHAT to describe / WHAT NOT to describe"
- ✅ 5 JSON schemas created and properly structured
- ✅ File `progress/status.json` created, initialized, and updated
- ✅ Template tested with example task and validated against schema structure

## Discovered Issues

- No issues encountered during infrastructure setup
- All existing files were properly structured and complete
- Templates already contained required Playwright research instructions
- Directory structure was already partially established from previous work

## Next Stage Preparation

- ✅ Status updated in progress/status.json with STAGE-1 marked as completed
- ✅ STAGE-2-INVENTORY marked as pending and ready for scanner subagent
- ✅ All infrastructure files ready for next stage consumption
- ✅ Template and schema validation completed successfully

## Recommendations for Next Agent (scanner)

- The infrastructure is fully ready for STAGE-2 inventory creation
- All templates contain comprehensive Playwright research instructions focusing on functionality over design
- JSON schemas are structured to capture detailed behavioral analysis rather than visual descriptions
- Example task demonstrates the expected level of detail and functional focus
- Progress tracking system is operational and ready for status updates

## Infrastructure Summary

**Directory Structure:**

```text
frontend_description/
├── masterplan.md
├── methodology/task-templates/ (5 templates)
├── inventory/ (ready for scanner)
├── tasks/level-1-architecture/ through level-5-api/ (ready)
├── results/schemas/ (5 JSON schemas)
└── progress/ (tracking system operational)
```

**Key Features Implemented:**

- Functionality-first specification approach
- Mandatory Playwright research integration
- Structured JSON output validation
- Progress tracking and stage coordination
- Template validation and testing capability

The infrastructure is complete and ready for systematic frontend decomposition according to the masterplan specifications.
