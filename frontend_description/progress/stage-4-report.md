### Supporting Infrastructure

- **Pages Inventory:** Created `inventory/pages-inventory.json` with complete page catalog
- **Mandatory Playwright Research:** Each task includes detailed interactive research requirements
- **API Integration Focus:** All tasks emphasize network monitoring and API documentation
- **Functional Focus:** Tasks focus on "WHAT it does" rather than visual design

## Task Quality Standards

Each task includes:

### ✅ Mandatory Research Components

- **Interactive Testing:** Complete user workflow testing with Playwright
- **API Monitoring:** Network tab monitoring for all operations
- **State Documentation:** Loading, error, empty, and success states
- **User Flow Validation:** End-to-end workflow verification
- **Integration Testing:** Cross-component interaction verification

### ✅ Deliverable Requirements

- **Functional Analysis:** Business operations and data flows
- **API Documentation:** Request/response patterns and error handling
- **Navigation Patterns:** Entry/exit points and integration paths
- **Component Behavior:** Interactive element states and transitions
- **Error Scenarios:** Comprehensive error condition testing

### ✅ Output Standards

- **Format Compliance:** Follows level-2-page-template structure
- **Token Optimization:** Each task sized for 10-15K tokens
- **Independence:** Tasks can be executed independently by different researchers
- **Actionable:** Each task produces implementable specifications

## Integration Architecture

### Page Relationships Documented

- **Navigation Flow:** Dashboard → Module pages → Detail pages
- **Universal Cart:** Integration across Equipment and Project pages
- **Barcode Scanner:** Integration with Equipment and Project workflows
- **Client-Project:** Relationship management across Client and Project pages

### Cross-Component Dependencies

- **Authentication:** Handled at Dashboard level, required for all pages
- **Universal Cart:** Shared across Equipment, Project Detail, and Scanner pages
- **Equipment Search:** Common component used in Equipment and Project pages
- **Client Selection:** Shared between Projects and Client management

## Success Criteria Achievement

### ✅ Task Creation Requirements

- [x] 10 page-level tasks created (TASK-002 to TASK-011)
- [x] Each task includes specific Playwright research instructions
- [x] Tasks focus on functionality over design
- [x] Optimal task sizing (10-15K tokens each)
- [x] All pages from inventory covered

### ✅ Quality Standards

- [x] Mandatory Playwright research for each task
- [x] Specific file paths and URLs provided
- [x] API integration requirements specified
- [x] Error scenario testing required
- [x] Cross-component integration documented

### ✅ Documentation Standards

- [x] Consistent task template usage

## Next Stage Preparation

**STAGE-5-LEVEL3:** Component/Module Analysis Tasks

- **Status:** Ready to begin
- **Prerequisites:** All Level 2 page tasks available for execution
- **Agent Required:** Component analysis specialist
- **Expected Outcome:** 15-25 component-level analysis tasks

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Application Verification

- **Development Server:** Confirmed running at <http://localhost:8000>
- **Database:** Sample data available for testing
- **Scanner Integration:** HID scanner interface accessible
- **Universal Cart:** Multi-mode integration confirmed

### Research Methodology

- **Interactive Testing:** Mandatory hands-on browser testing
- **API Monitoring:** DevTools Network tab monitoring required
- **State Validation:** All functional states must be triggered and documented
- **Integration Verification:** Cross-component behavior must be validated

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks and Solutions

1. **Playwright Complexity:** Detailed step-by-step instructions provided
2. **API Documentation:** Network monitoring requirements specified
3. **Component Integration:** Cross-page relationships clearly defined
4. **Task Independence:** Each task self-contained with complete context

### Quality Assurance

- **Template Consistency:** All tasks follow identical structure
- **Scope Management:** Clear boundaries between page-level and component-level analysis
- **Deliverable Clarity:** Specific output formats and requirements defined

## Conclusion

STAGE 4 successfully established the foundation for detailed page-level analysis with comprehensive Playwright research requirements. All 10 major application pages now have dedicated analysis tasks that will produce the functional specifications needed for modern frontend reconstruction.

The tasks are designed to be executed by frontend research specialists who will use interactive browser testing to understand the actual behavior of each page, rather than relying solely on code analysis. This approach ensures accurate documentation of the real user experience that CINERENTAL staff depend on daily.
