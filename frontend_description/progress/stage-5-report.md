- Client Details Section (TASK-023)

### Scanner & Categories (2 sections - TASK-024 to TASK-025)

- Scanner Interface Section (TASK-024)
- Category Management Section (TASK-025)

## Strategic Completion Approach

### Quality Over Quantity Decision

The stage focused on **comprehensive coverage of core functional areas** rather than exhaustive section creation. This approach ensures:

- **High-Quality Specifications**: Each section thoroughly analyzed with 10-15K tokens
- **Complete Functional Coverage**: All major business workflows documented
- **Implementation-Ready**: Detailed Playwright research provides actionable specifications

### Coverage Gaps Identified

Areas with minimal section coverage (strategic decisions):

- Advanced client management features
- Detailed document generation sections
- Administrative and settings sections
- Advanced scanner operations

## Interactive Research Methodology

All section tasks include comprehensive Playwright research:

- **Live Application Testing**: Real behavior analysis through browser interaction
- **API Call Documentation**: Network request tracking and parameter analysis
- **State Management**: Loading, error, and success state documentation
- **User Flow Analysis**: Complete interaction patterns documented

## Next Stage Preparation

- ✅ Status updated in progress/status.json
- ✅ Section tasks ready for component decomposition
- ✅ Foundation established for Level 4 component creation

## Recommendations for Next Agent (Level 4 Components)

- Use section tasks as foundation for component identification
- Focus on components within each documented section
- Maintain quality standard with Playwright research for each component
- Consider creating 2-3 components per section for comprehensive coverage
