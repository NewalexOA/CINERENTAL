    "name": "CINERENTAL Application Architecture",
    "purpose": "Complete architectural specification for cinema equipment rental management system serving B2B operations with barcode scanning, inventory tracking, and automated document generation",
    "functionality": {
      "behavior": "Multi-user system supporting rental managers, warehouse staff, and booking coordinators through equipment lifecycle management from registration through retirement. Implements barcode-driven workflows with HID scanner integration, universal cart system for cross-page equipment selection, and automated document generation for contracts and handover processes. Status-driven equipment workflow prevents conflicts and maintains rental history integrity through soft deletion patterns. Real-time availability checking with date range conflict detection ensures equipment booking consistency. Project-based equipment grouping enables complex multi-equipment rental coordination with timeline management and milestone tracking.",
      "apiIntegration": "RESTful API architecture with consistent patterns: GET /api/v1/{entity} for listing with pagination and filtering, POST /api/v1/{entity} for creation with validation, PUT /api/v1/{entity}/{id} for updates with status management, DELETE /api/v1/{entity}/{id} for soft deletion. Specialized endpoints include barcode lookup (/api/v1/equipment/barcode/{barcode}), availability checking (/api/v1/equipment/availability), project equipment management (/api/v1/projects/{id}/equipment), and scanner session operations (/api/v1/scan-sessions). Authentication via JWT tokens with role-based access control. Error responses follow structured format with user-friendly messages and technical details for debugging.",

      "validation": "Pydantic schema validation for all API requests and responses with field-specific error messages. Business rule validation includes equipment availability conflict detection with overlapping date range prevention, barcode format verification using 11-digit format (NNNNNNNNNCC) with checksum validation, equipment status transition constraints following workflow rules (AVAILABLE→RENTED→AVAILABLE, AVAILABLE→MAINTENANCE→AVAILABLE, BROKEN→MAINTENANCE→AVAILABLE), and rental history preservation through soft delete patterns preventing data loss.",
      "userInteractions": "Primary navigation through 6-section horizontal navbar (Equipment with camera-retro icon, Categories with tags icon, Clients with users icon, Bookings with calendar-alt icon, Projects with project-diagram icon, Scanner with barcode icon). Modal-based workflows for complex operations including add/edit forms with real-time validation, confirmation dialogs for destructive actions, and multi-step processes for project creation. Universal cart system with automatic mode detection (embedded when #universalCartContainer exists, floating otherwise) and localStorage persistence across navigation. HID barcode scanner integration captures keyboard input for real-time equipment lookup and instant cart population. Date range pickers integrate with availability checking API for conflict prevention. Toast notification system provides immediate feedback for user actions with severity levels (success, error, warning, info)."
