## Component Integration

### Parent Integration

**Communication:** Reports selected client to project creation form
**Dependencies:** Receives project context and validation requirements from parent
**Events:** Sends 'clientSelected', 'clientCreated', 'validationComplete' events

### Sibling Integration

**Shared State:** Coordinates with other project form fields for validation
**Event Communication:** Receives 'projectDataChanged' events for context updates
**Data Sharing:** Uses shared project creation state and validation context

### System Integration

**Global State:** Uses global client database and user permissions
**External Services:** Integrates with client management and project systems
**Browser APIs:** Uses debouncing for search optimization

## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. **Client Selection:** User starts typing client name or company
2. **Search Results:** System shows matching clients with relevant details
3. **Client Selection:** User selects appropriate client from results
4. **Validation:** System validates client eligibility for project
5. **Confirmation:** User proceeds with validated client assignment

### Alternative Flows

**New Client Flow:** User creates new client during project creation
**Recent Client Flow:** User selects from recently used clients
**Client Details Flow:** User views client information before selection

### Error Recovery Flows

**Search Error:** User modifies search terms or retries search
**Validation Error:** User selects different client or resolves client issues
**Creation Error:** User corrects new client information and retries

## Validation and Constraints

### Input Validation

**Search Validation:** Search queries must meet minimum length requirements
**Client Validation:** Selected clients must exist and be accessible
**Creation Validation:** New client data must meet all required field rules

### Business Constraints

**Client Status:** Only active clients eligible for new project assignment
**Credit Limits:** Clients with credit issues may have project restrictions
**Permission Rules:** User must have permission to assign clients to projects

### Technical Constraints
