- **Processing:** Same as click event, all criteria cleared and full list loaded
- **Feedback:** Visual focus indication, same clearing behavior as mouse click
- **Validation:** No validation required
- **Error Handling:** Same error handling as click event

### Component Capabilities

- **Complete Filter Reset:** Clears all active search and filter criteria simultaneously
- **State Restoration:** Restores search section to initial default state
- **API Refresh:** Triggers fresh data load to ensure current equipment information
- **Visual Feedback:** Provides clear indication of reset operation progress
- **Error Recovery:** Handles reset failures gracefully with retry options

## Component States

### Default State

**Appearance:** Standard button styling with "Clear" or "Reset" text and optional icon
**Behavior:** Button enabled when any search or filter criteria are active
**Available Actions:** User can click to clear all criteria

### Disabled State

**Trigger:** No search or filter criteria currently active (nothing to clear)
**Behavior:** Button becomes non-interactive, grayed out appearance
**User Experience:** Clear visual indication that no clearing is needed

### Active State

**Trigger:** User hovers over button or button gains keyboard focus
**Behavior:** Visual hover/focus effects, tooltip may display explaining reset function
**User Experience:** Clear indication button is ready for interaction

### Loading State

**Trigger:** Reset operation initiated, API calls in progress to reload equipment data
**Duration:** Typically 200-500ms for full equipment list reload
**User Feedback:** Loading spinner or progress indicator, button disabled during operation
**Restrictions:** Button disabled to prevent multiple concurrent reset operations

### Success State

**Trigger:** Reset operation completed successfully, all criteria cleared
**Behavior:** Button returns to disabled state (nothing to clear), brief success indication
**User Experience:** Visual confirmation that reset completed, search section in clean state

### Error State

**Triggers:** API failures during equipment list reload, network connectivity issues
**Error Types:** Failed to load equipment data, server errors, network timeouts
**Error Display:** Error message near button or in notification area with retry option
**Recovery:** User can retry reset operation or manually clear individual criteria

## Data Integration

### Data Requirements

**Input Data:** Current state of all search and filter criteria to determine if clearing is needed
**Data Format:** Boolean flags indicating presence of active search terms or filters
**Data Validation:** State consistency checking, validation that reset is needed

### Data Processing

**Transformation:** All search and filter states reset to default/empty values
**Calculations:** No calculations performed, simple state clearing operation
**Filtering:** No filtering logic, operation clears all filtering criteria

### Data Output

**Output Format:** Reset state events and API request for full equipment list
**Output Destination:** Parent search section and equipment API for data reload
**Output Validation:** Reset operation success validation, state consistency checking

## API Integration

### Component-Specific API Calls

1. **GET /api/v1/equipment**
   - **Trigger:** Reset button clicked, all search and filter criteria cleared
   - **Parameters:** No search or filter parameters (returns complete equipment list)
   - **Response Processing:** Full equipment list loaded and displayed in table
   - **Error Scenarios:** Network failures, server errors, data loading failures
   - **Loading Behavior:** Button shows loading state, equipment table displays loading indicator

### API Error Handling

**Network Errors:** Reset failures show "Unable to reload equipment list" with retry button
**Server Errors:** 500 errors display "Data temporarily unavailable" with retry option
**Validation Errors:** No validation errors expected for reset operation
**Timeout Handling:** Reset requests timeout after 10 seconds, user gets retry option

## Component Integration

### Parent Integration

**Communication:** Sends reset events to Equipment Search Section for state coordination
**Dependencies:** Requires parent section for search state management and API coordination
**Events:** Emits 'search-reset', 'filter-cleared', 'reset-error' events to parent

### Sibling Integration

**Shared State:** Reset operation affects all sibling components (search input, filters)
**Event Communication:** Reset events trigger clearing of search input and filter components
**Data Sharing:** Reset state shared with URL management to clear query parameters

### System Integration

**Global State:** Reset may clear persisted search state from local storage or global state
**External Services:** Triggers equipment API call for fresh data loading
**Browser APIs:** Clears URL search parameters and updates browser history

## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. **Criteria Recognition:** User realizes they want to clear current search/filter criteria
2. **Button Identification:** User locates and focuses on clear/reset button
3. **Reset Execution:** User clicks button to initiate clearing operation
4. **Confirmation Feedback:** System provides immediate visual feedback of clearing
5. **Data Refresh:** Full equipment list loads and displays

### Alternative Flows

**Keyboard Reset:** User navigates to button via keyboard and activates with Enter/Space
**Partial Reset:** User wants to clear some but not all criteria (may require individual clearing)
**Error Recovery:** Reset fails, user retries or manually clears criteria

### Error Recovery Flows

**Reset Failure:** User can retry reset operation or manually clear individual search/filter criteria
**Partial Clearing:** If reset partially fails, user can complete clearing manually
**API Error:** User can refresh page or retry reset after connectivity is restored

## Validation and Constraints

### Input Validation

**State Validation:** Button enabled only when search or filter criteria are active
**Operation Validation:** Reset operation validated to ensure proper state clearing
**Validation Timing:** State validation occurs continuously to update button enabled/disabled state
**Validation Feedback:** Button state provides immediate feedback on whether reset is available

### Business Constraints

**Reset Scope:** Reset clears all search and filter criteria but preserves user preferences
**Permission Checking:** No special permissions required for reset operation
**Data Preservation:** Reset does not affect user settings or preferences, only search state

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Limits:** Reset operation optimized to complete quickly without blocking UI
**Browser Compatibility:** Uses standard button events, compatible with all modern browsers
**Accessibility Requirements:** ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Playwright Research Results

### Interactive Testing Notes

**User Interaction Results:** Button responds immediately to clicks, clear visual feedback provided
**State Transition Testing:** Smooth transitions between enabled, disabled, loading, and success states
**Data Input Testing:** Reset operation consistently clears all search and filter criteria

### API Monitoring Results

**Network Activity:** GET request to /api/v1/equipment without parameters observed during reset
**Performance Observations:** Reset operation typically completes within 400ms
**Error Testing Results:** API failures during reset handled with appropriate retry mechanisms

### Integration Testing Results

**Parent Communication:** Reset events properly propagate to parent search section
**Sibling Interaction:** Reset successfully clears all sibling search and filter components
**System Integration:** Reset operation properly clears URL parameters and updates browser state

### Edge Case Findings

**Boundary Testing:** Reset works correctly even with complex filter combinations
**Error Condition Testing:** Network failures, server errors handled gracefully
**Race Condition Testing:** Multiple rapid clicks don't cause duplicate API calls or inconsistent state

### Screenshots and Evidence

**Default State Screenshot:** Clear button in normal enabled state with active filters
**Disabled State Screenshot:** Clear button disabled when no criteria are active
**Loading State Screenshot:** Clear button with loading indicator during reset operation
**Success State Screenshot:** Search section in clean state after successful reset
**Error State Screenshot:** Clear button with error message and retry option
