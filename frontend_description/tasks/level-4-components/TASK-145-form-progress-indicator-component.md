- **Error Handling:** Progress calculation errors handled with fallback displays and manual progress indicators

#### Section Navigation and Status
- **Trigger:** User navigates between form sections requiring status updates and navigation guidance
- **Processing:** Component manages section status tracking with completion validation and navigation control
- **Feedback:** Section status indicators, navigation breadcrumbs, completion checkmarks, current section highlighting
- **Validation:** Section completion validated against requirements before allowing navigation progression
- **Error Handling:** Incomplete sections handled with requirement identification and completion guidance

#### Milestone and Achievement Tracking
- **Trigger:** Significant form completion milestones reached requiring user recognition and motivation
- **Processing:** Component identifies completion milestones and provides achievement feedback with progress encouragement
- **Feedback:** Milestone celebrations, achievement badges, progress congratulations, completion time estimates
- **Validation:** Milestone criteria validated for accuracy and appropriate recognition timing
- **Error Handling:** Milestone detection errors handled with manual recognition options and progress preservation

**Available Actions:** Begin form completion, navigate to sections, view requirements, access help

### Active Progress Tracking State
**Appearance:** Partially filled progress bar with section completion indicators and current percentage display
**Behavior:** Real-time progress updates with section status tracking and navigation guidance
**Available Actions:** Continue form completion, navigate between sections, review progress, access completed sections

### Milestone Achievement State
**Trigger:** Significant completion milestone reached requiring user recognition and celebration
**Behavior:** Achievement notification with milestone celebration and progress encouragement
**User Experience:** Positive reinforcement with clear milestone recognition and continued motivation

### Completion State
**Trigger:** Form completion reached with all required sections and fields completed successfully
**Behavior:** Full progress bar with completion celebration and final submission guidance
**User Experience:** Achievement recognition with clear completion confirmation and next steps

## Data Integration

### Data Requirements
**Input Data:** Form structure, completion criteria, section definitions, validation requirements, user progress
**Data Format:** Progress objects with completion percentages, section status, milestone definitions, navigation state
**Data Validation:** Progress accuracy verification, completion criteria validation, milestone achievement confirmation

### Data Processing
**Transformation:** Progress calculation, completion percentage computation, section status determination
**Calculations:** Completion algorithms, milestone detection, progress weighting, time estimation
**Filtering:** Relevant section filtering, completed item identification, milestone eligibility assessment

## API Integration

### Component-Specific API Calls
1. **GET /api/v1/forms/{id}/progress**
   - **Trigger:** Component initialization or progress refresh request
   - **Parameters:** `form_id`, `include_sections`, `calculate_estimates`
