### Loading State

**Trigger:** Selection changes processing, API calls for selection validation in progress
**Duration:** Typically 100-300ms for selection validation
**User Feedback:** Loading indicators on affected checkboxes
**Restrictions:** Checkboxes may be disabled during validation to prevent conflicts

### Error State

**Triggers:** Selection validation failures, permission errors, API failures
**Error Types:** Insufficient permissions, equipment locked by other users, system errors
**Error Display:** Error messaging near checkboxes or in notification area
**Recovery:** User can retry selection or proceed with valid selections only

## Data Integration

### Data Requirements

**Input Data:** Equipment selectability rules, user permissions, current equipment status
**Data Format:** Equipment objects with selectable flags, permission arrays
**Data Validation:** Selection permission validation, equipment state checking

### Data Processing

**Transformation:** Equipment objects converted to selection state objects
**Calculations:** Selection count calculation, bulk operation validation
**Filtering:** Selectable equipment identification, permission-based filtering

### Data Output

**Output Format:** Array of selected equipment IDs for batch operations
**Output Destination:** Bulk action APIs, selection state management
**Output Validation:** Selected equipment ID validation, permission verification

## API Integration

### Component-Specific API Calls

1. **POST /api/v1/equipment/validate-selection**
   - **Trigger:** Large bulk selections to validate all items are still selectable
   - **Parameters:** Array of equipment IDs selected by user
   - **Response Processing:** Validation results processed, invalid selections removed
   - **Error Scenarios:** Equipment locked, permission changes, status conflicts
   - **Loading Behavior:** Selection checkboxes show validation loading state

2. **GET /api/v1/equipment/{id}/permissions**
   - **Trigger:** Individual row selection for items requiring permission checking
   - **Parameters:** Equipment ID for permission validation
   - **Response Processing:** Selection allowed/denied based on permission response
   - **Error Scenarios:** Permission API failures, invalid equipment IDs
   - **Loading Behavior:** Individual checkbox shows loading during validation

### API Error Handling

**Network Errors:** Selection validation failures allow proceeding with cached permissions
**Server Errors:** Permission validation errors show warning but allow selection
**Validation Errors:** Invalid selections automatically removed with user notification
**Timeout Handling:** Selection validation timeouts proceed with optimistic selection

## Component Integration

### Parent Integration

**Communication:** Sends selection events to Equipment Table Section for bulk operation coordination
**Dependencies:** Requires parent table for row data and bulk action management
**Events:** Emits 'selection-changed', 'bulk-selected', 'selection-error' events

### Sibling Integration

**Shared State:** Selection state affects bulk action button states and availability
**Event Communication:** Selection changes trigger bulk action panel updates
**Data Sharing:** Selected equipment IDs shared with bulk action components

### System Integration

**Global State:** Selection state may persist across page navigation in user session
**External Services:** Integrates with permission and equipment APIs for validation
**Browser APIs:** Uses local storage for selection persistence across browser sessions

## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. **Item Identification:** User identifies equipment items needing bulk operation
2. **Individual Selection:** User clicks checkboxes for specific equipment items
3. **Selection Review:** User reviews selected items and selection count
4. **Bulk Action:** User proceeds to bulk action with selected equipment
5. **Selection Clearing:** User clears selections after completing operations

### Alternative Flows

**Bulk Selection:** User uses "select all" for quick selection of entire page
**Range Selection:** User uses Shift+click to select contiguous ranges of equipment
**Filtered Selection:** User applies filters then selects from filtered results
**Cross-Page Selection:** User maintains selections while navigating between pages

### Error Recovery Flows

**Selection Failure:** User retries selection or proceeds with successfully selected items
**Permission Error:** User receives explanation and guidance on permission requirements
**Validation Failure:** Invalid selections removed with notification, user can adjust selection

## Validation and Constraints

### Input Validation

**Selectability Rules:** Equipment items validated for selectability based on status and permissions
**Permission Validation:** User permissions checked for each selected equipment item
**Business Rule Validation:** Equipment business rules applied (e.g., rented items may not be selectable)
**Validation Timing:** Validation occurs on selection and before bulk operations
**Validation Feedback:** Non-selectable items clearly marked with explanatory tooltips

### Business Constraints

**Selection Limits:** Maximum number of items that can be selected for bulk operations
**Permission Requirements:** Users can only select equipment they have permission to modify
**Status Restrictions:** Equipment in certain statuses may not be selectable
**Operational Rules:** Some equipment may be locked during active operations

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Limits:** Selection operations optimized for large equipment datasets
**Browser Compatibility:** Uses standard checkbox events and ARIA attributes
**Accessibility Requirements:** ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader announcements
