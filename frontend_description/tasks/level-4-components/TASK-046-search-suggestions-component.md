## Component States

### Inactive State

**Appearance:** No suggestions shown, component waiting for input
**Behavior:** Monitoring search input for trigger conditions
**Available Actions:** None visible, waiting for user input

### Loading State

**Trigger:** User input triggers suggestion request, waiting for results
**Duration:** Brief loading period during suggestion retrieval (typically <300ms)
**User Feedback:** Loading indicator in dropdown or input field
**Restrictions:** May show previous suggestions or empty state while loading

### Active State

**Trigger:** Suggestions available and displayed
**Behavior:** Dropdown showing relevant suggestions with navigation support
**User Experience:** Clear list of selectable suggestions

### No Suggestions State

**Trigger:** User input doesn't match any available suggestions
**Behavior:** May show "No suggestions" message or alternative search help
**User Experience:** Clear indication that no matching suggestions available

### Error State

**Triggers:** Suggestion API failure, network issues, processing errors
**Error Types:** Network errors, API failures, parsing errors
**Error Display:** Error message in dropdown or fallback to no suggestions
**Recovery:** Retry mechanism or degraded functionality without suggestions

### Selected State

**Trigger:** User highlights specific suggestion with keyboard or mouse
**Behavior:** Highlighted suggestion shown with selection indicators
**User Experience:** Clear visual indication of which suggestion will be selected

## Data Integration

### Data Requirements

**Input Data:** Partial search query, available search terms, context information
**Data Format:** String input, array of suggestion objects with relevance scores
**Data Validation:** Input must be sanitized, suggestions must be valid search terms

### Data Processing

**Transformation:** Converts partial input into relevant suggestion queries
**Calculations:** Relevance scoring, fuzzy matching, ranking algorithms
**Filtering:** Filters suggestions based on relevance and user context

### Data Output

**Output Format:** Suggestion objects with display text and search values
**Output Destination:** Dropdown display component, search input field
**Output Validation:** Ensures suggestions are valid and executable

## API Integration

### Component-Specific API Calls

1. **GET /api/v1/{resource}/search/suggestions**
   - **Trigger:** User input in search field (debounced, typically 300ms delay)
   - **Parameters:** query string, limit, context (page type, filters)
   - **Response Processing:** Displays returned suggestions in dropdown
   - **Error Scenarios:** Network failures, API timeouts, no suggestions available
   - **Loading Behavior:** Shows loading state during API call

2. **GET /api/v1/{resource}/search/autocomplete**
   - **Trigger:** Similar to suggestions but for exact term completion
   - **Parameters:** partial query, completion type
   - **Response Processing:** Provides exact completions for partial terms
   - **Error Scenarios:** Completion service unavailable, invalid partial terms
   - **Loading Behavior:** Fast completion without obvious loading states

### API Error Handling

**Network Errors:** Falls back to cached suggestions or no suggestions
**Server Errors:** Graceful degradation without suggestions functionality
**Timeout Errors:** Uses cached data or continues without suggestions
**Rate Limiting:** Implements proper debouncing to prevent rate limit issues

## Component Integration

### Parent Integration

**Communication:** Receives search context and configuration from parent search system
**Dependencies:** Requires search input field, current search context
**Events:** Sends suggestion selection events to parent search component

### Sibling Integration

**Shared State:** Coordinates with search input for query updates
**Event Communication:** Communicates selection with search execution components
**Data Sharing:** Shares suggestion data with search history system

### System Integration

**Global State:** May access global search configuration and user preferences
**External Services:** Integrates with search API and suggestion services
**Browser APIs:** Uses debouncing, keyboard event handling, DOM positioning

## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. **Input Start:** User begins typing in search field
2. **Suggestion Trigger:** After sufficient input, suggestions begin appearing
3. **Suggestion Review:** User reviews available suggestions in dropdown
4. **Selection:** User selects appropriate suggestion via click or keyboard
5. **Search Completion:** Selected suggestion completes search input, search may execute

### Alternative Flows

**Direct Typing:** User continues typing without selecting suggestions
**Keyboard Navigation:** User navigates and selects suggestions using only keyboard
**Suggestion Dismissal:** User dismisses suggestions to type manually

### Error Recovery Flows

**No Suggestions:** User continues with manual typing when no suggestions available
**Selection Failure:** Fallback to manual search completion if suggestion selection fails
**API Failure:** Continues without suggestions, provides manual search guidance

## Validation and Constraints

### Input Validation

**Input Sanitization:** User input must be sanitized before suggestion requests
**Query Length:** Minimum query length before suggestions triggered
**Validation Timing:** Real-time validation as user types
**Validation Feedback:** No explicit feedback, suggestions simply don't appear for invalid input

### Business Constraints

**Privacy Considerations:** Suggestions shouldn't reveal unauthorized information
**Performance Limits:** Suggestion requests must be rate-limited and debounced
**Content Appropriateness:** Suggestions must be appropriate for current user context

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Limits:** Suggestion API calls must be fast (<300ms typically)
**Browser Compatibility:** Dropdown positioning and keyboard handling across browsers
**Accessibility Requirements:** Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation

## Playwright Research Results

**State Transition Testing:** Proper transitions between inactive, loading, and active states
**Data Input Testing:** Suggestions relevant and accurate for various input scenarios

### API Monitoring Results

**Network Activity:** Efficient debounced API calls, minimal network overhead
**Performance Observations:** Suggestions typically appear within 200-400ms of typing pause
**Error Testing Results:** Graceful handling of API failures with appropriate fallbacks

### Integration Testing Results

**Parent Communication:** Seamless integration with search input and execution systems
**Sibling Interaction:** Proper coordination with search history and autocomplete features
