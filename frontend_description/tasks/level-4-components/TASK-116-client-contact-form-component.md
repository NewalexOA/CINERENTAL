## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. **Form Initialization:** User opens client creation/edit modal, form loads with appropriate defaults
2. **Data Entry:** User fills in client information with real-time validation and formatting assistance
3. **Validation and Submission:** User submits form, validation completes, client record created/updated

### Alternative Flows
**Import Data Flow:** User imports client information from external source (CSV, vCard, clipboard)
**Duplicate Resolution Flow:** System detects potential duplicate, user chooses merge or create new client
**Address Assistance Flow:** User enables location services for automatic address completion

### Error Recovery Flows
**Validation Error Recovery:** User corrects validation errors based on specific guidance and resubmits
**Network Error Recovery:** User retries submission after connectivity restored or saves locally
**Duplicate Conflict Recovery:** User merges with existing client or modifies information to differentiate

## Validation and Constraints
