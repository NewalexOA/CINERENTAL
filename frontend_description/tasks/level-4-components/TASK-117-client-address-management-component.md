## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. **Address Review:** User views existing client addresses with current defaults and validation status
2. **Address Management:** User adds, edits, or removes addresses with real-time validation feedback
3. **Default Configuration:** User sets appropriate default addresses for different business operations

### Alternative Flows
**Bulk Address Import Flow:** User imports multiple addresses from external source with validation
**Address Verification Flow:** System prompts user to verify addresses that fail validation
**Delivery Zone Check Flow:** User validates addresses against service delivery areas

### Error Recovery Flows
**Validation Error Recovery:** User corrects invalid addresses based on specific validation guidance
**Geocoding Failure Recovery:** User manually confirms address details or uses alternative validation
**Service Area Recovery:** User modifies address to fall within service area or requests exception

## Validation and Constraints

### Input Validation
**Address Format Rule:** Street address, city, and postal code required with proper formatting
**Postal Code Validation:** Country-specific postal code format validation with checksum verification
**Geographic Validation:** Address must exist and be deliverable according to geocoding service
**Type Requirements:** Each address type has specific validation rules and required fields
**Validation Timing:** Real-time validation during input with debounced API calls
**Validation Feedback:** Specific error messages with correction suggestions and examples

### Business Constraints
**Default Address Rules:** At least one billing address required, only one default per type allowed
**Address Limits:** Maximum 10 addresses per client to prevent database performance issues
**Service Area Restrictions:** Addresses must fall within configured service delivery areas
**Active Address Protection:** Addresses associated with active projects cannot be deleted

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Limits:** Geocoding requests throttled to prevent API quota exhaustion
**Browser Compatibility:** Full functionality in modern browsers with graceful degradation
**Accessibility Requirements:** Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, high contrast compatibility
