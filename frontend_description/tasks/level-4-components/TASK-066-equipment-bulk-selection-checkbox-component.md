## Data Integration

### Data Requirements

**Input Data:** Equipment item data, user permissions, bulk operation context
**Data Format:** Equipment object, permissions array, selection state boolean
**Data Validation:** Validates equipment exists and user can perform bulk operations

### Data Processing

**Transformation:** Converts equipment selection state to bulk operation inclusion
**Calculations:** Updates selection counts and bulk operation availability
**Filtering:** Applies permission-based filtering for selectable equipment

### Data Output

**Output Format:** Selection state object with equipment ID and selection timestamp
**Output Destination:** Bulk operations system, selection state management
**Output Validation:** Ensures selection state consistency across system

## API Integration

### Component-Specific API Calls

1. **POST /api/v1/equipment/bulk-select**
   - **Trigger:** User selects/deselects equipment for bulk operations
   - **Parameters:** Equipment ID, selection state, operation context
   - **Response Processing:** Updates selection confirmation and bulk operation availability
   - **Error Scenarios:** Permission denied, equipment locked, system errors
   - **Loading Behavior:** Brief loading state during selection confirmation

2. **GET /api/v1/equipment/bulk-permissions**
   - **Trigger:** Component initialization to determine selectable equipment
   - **Parameters:** User context, equipment list, operation types
   - **Response Processing:** Updates checkbox availability based on permissions
   - **Error Scenarios:** Permission service unavailable, user context invalid
   - **Loading Behavior:** Checkboxes disabled until permissions determined

### API Error Handling

**Network Errors:** Maintains local selection state, syncs when connection restored
**Permission Errors:** Disables checkboxes for unauthorized equipment
**Server Errors:** Shows error notification, allows retry of selection

## Component Integration

### Parent Integration

**Communication:** Reports selection changes to bulk operations controller
**Dependencies:** Receives equipment context and permissions from parent list
**Events:** Sends 'selectionChanged', 'bulkOperationReady' events

### Sibling Integration

**Shared State:** Coordinates with select-all checkbox and bulk action controls
**Event Communication:** Receives 'selectAll', 'clearAll', 'operationComplete' events
**Data Sharing:** Uses shared selection state across equipment list

### System Integration

**Global State:** Uses global bulk operation state and user permissions
**External Services:** Integrates with equipment management and authorization systems
**Browser APIs:** Uses accessibility APIs for keyboard and screen reader support

## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. **Equipment Review:** User reviews equipment list for bulk operations
2. **Individual Selection:** User clicks checkboxes for specific equipment items
3. **Selection Feedback:** System shows selection count and available operations
4. **Bulk Operation:** User performs bulk operations on selected equipment
5. **Selection Reset:** System clears selections after operation completion

### Alternative Flows

**Select All Flow:** User selects all equipment using select-all control
**Filtered Selection Flow:** User selects equipment within specific filters
**Keyboard Navigation Flow:** User selects equipment using keyboard only

### Error Recovery Flows

**Selection Error:** User retries selection or checks permissions
**Permission Error:** User requests additional permissions or selects different equipment
**Operation Error:** User reviews failed selections and retries operation

## Validation and Constraints
