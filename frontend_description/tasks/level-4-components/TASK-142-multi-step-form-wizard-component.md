# TASK-142: Multi-step Form Wizard Component Analysis

## Component Overview
**Parent Section:** Advanced Form Components Section
**Parent Page:** Complex Form Workflows (Project Creation, Equipment Registration, Client Onboarding)
**Component Purpose:** Guide users through complex multi-step forms with progress tracking, validation, and state management for efficient data collection
**Page URL:** Various complex form workflows throughout the system
**Component Selector:** `#multiStepFormWizard` or `.form-wizard-container`

## Component Functionality

### Primary Function
**Purpose:** Provide intuitive multi-step form experience with clear progress indication, step validation, and seamless navigation for complex data collection processes
**User Goal:** Complete complex forms efficiently with clear guidance, progress tracking, and validation feedback at each step
**Input:** Form data across multiple steps, navigation actions, validation requirements, step configurations
**Output:** Completed form data with validation results, progress tracking, and successful submission confirmation

### User Interactions
#### Step Navigation and Progress Tracking
- **Trigger:** User navigates between form steps using navigation controls or step indicators
- **Processing:** Component manages step transitions with validation checking and progress state updates
- **Feedback:** Progress bar updates, step completion indicators, navigation button state changes
- **Validation:** Step completion validated before allowing navigation to subsequent steps
- **Error Handling:** Incomplete steps prevented from progression with clear completion requirements

#### Step-by-Step Validation
- **Trigger:** User completes form fields triggering step-level validation before progression
- **Processing:** Component validates current step data against business rules and required field constraints
- **Feedback:** Field-level validation indicators, step completion status, error summaries with correction guidance
- **Validation:** Comprehensive validation including field requirements, data formats, and business rules
- **Error Handling:** Validation failures block step progression with specific error identification and resolution guidance

#### Form State Management and Persistence
- **Trigger:** User interacts with form fields requiring state preservation across steps and browser sessions
- **Processing:** Component maintains form state with auto-save functionality and session persistence
- **Feedback:** Auto-save indicators, draft status display, data recovery notifications on session restoration
- **Validation:** State persistence validated for data integrity and completeness across sessions
- **Error Handling:** State corruption handled with data recovery options and user notification of potential data loss

## Component States

### Form Initialization State
**Duration:** 1-2 seconds for form configuration and initial step preparation
**User Feedback:** Loading indicator with form preparation status and step configuration confirmation
**Restrictions:** Form interaction disabled until initialization completes and first step becomes available

### Active Step State
**Appearance:** Current step form fields with navigation controls, progress indicator, and validation feedback
**Behavior:** Interactive form with real-time validation, auto-save functionality, and navigation management
**Available Actions:** Fill form fields, navigate between steps, save progress, submit completed form

### Step Validation State
**Trigger:** User attempts step navigation requiring validation of current step completion
**Behavior:** Validation processing with field checking, error identification, and progression approval
**User Experience:** Clear validation feedback with error highlighting and correction guidance

## Data Integration

### Data Requirements
**Input Data:** Form field definitions, validation rules, step configurations, user progress data
**Data Format:** Form schema objects with step definitions, field specifications, validation rules
**Data Validation:** Step completion verification, field requirement checking, business rule validation

### Data Processing
**Transformation:** Form data structuring, validation result formatting, progress calculation
**Calculations:** Completion percentage, validation scoring, step dependency resolution
**Filtering:** Step visibility filtering, field availability filtering, validation rule application

## API Integration

### Component-Specific API Calls
1. **POST /api/v1/forms/wizard/save-progress**
   - **Trigger:** Auto-save functionality or manual progress save by user
   - **Parameters:** `form_id`, `step_data`, `progress_state`, `session_info`
   - **Response Processing:** Save form progress with state preservation and completion tracking
   - **Error Scenarios:** Save failed (500), session expired (401), data validation error (422)

2. **POST /api/v1/forms/wizard/validate-step**
   - **Trigger:** Step completion validation before allowing navigation progression
   - **Parameters:** `form_id`, `step_id`, `step_data`, `validation_rules`
   - **Response Processing:** Validate step data and provide progression approval or error details
   - **Error Scenarios:** Validation failed (400), step data incomplete (422), business rule violation (409)
