**Available Actions:** Cancel operation (if supported), view detailed progress

### Error State

**Triggers:** Bulk operation failure, partial completion, permission conflicts
**Error Types:** Network errors, permission denials, validation failures, partial successes
**Error Display:** Error summary with details of failed items
**Recovery:** Retry failed items, manual resolution options, undo if possible

### Success State

**Trigger:** Bulk operation completes successfully
**Behavior:** Success message with operation summary, toolbar may hide automatically
**User Experience:** Clear confirmation of successful operation with details

## Data Integration

### Data Requirements

**Input Data:** Selected item IDs, item types, user permissions, available bulk actions
**Data Format:** Array of selected item objects, permissions array, actions configuration
**Data Validation:** All selected items must exist and be accessible by current user

### Data Processing

**Transformation:** Converts selected items into batch operation parameters
**Calculations:** Determines action applicability across selected item set
**Filtering:** Removes actions not applicable to current selection mix

### Data Output

**Output Format:** Batch operation parameters (item IDs array, action type, options)
**Output Destination:** Batch API endpoints, progress tracking system
**Output Validation:** Ensures batch parameters complete and consistent

## API Integration

### Component-Specific API Calls

1. **POST /api/v1/equipment/bulk-actions/{action_type}**
   - **Trigger:** User initiates bulk action from toolbar
   - **Parameters:** item IDs array, action type, action-specific parameters
   - **Response Processing:** Handles batch operation results, updates table
   - **Error Scenarios:** Partial failures, permission conflicts, validation errors
   - **Loading Behavior:** Shows progress indicators, handles long-running operations

2. **GET /api/v1/equipment/bulk-actions/available**
   - **Trigger:** Selection changes, need to determine available actions
   - **Parameters:** selected item IDs, current user context
   - **Response Processing:** Updates toolbar with available actions for current selection
   - **Error Scenarios:** Permission check failures, item state conflicts
   - **Loading Behavior:** May show loading state while determining actions

3. **POST /api/v1/equipment/bulk-actions/validate**
   - **Trigger:** Before executing bulk action, validate all items can support action
   - **Parameters:** item IDs array, proposed action type
   - **Response Processing:** Shows conflicts or confirms action can proceed
   - **Error Scenarios:** Validation failures, conflicting item states
   - **Loading Behavior:** Quick validation check before action execution

### API Error Handling

**Network Errors:** Retry mechanism with exponential backoff, progress preservation
**Server Errors:** Partial failure handling, detailed error reporting per item
**Validation Errors:** Pre-validation prevents most errors, clear conflict reporting
**Timeout Handling:** Long operation timeout handling with resume capability

## Component Integration

### Parent Integration

**Communication:** Receives selection state from table component
**Dependencies:** Requires item selection system, table row components
**Events:** Sends bulk action events to parent table for updates

### Sibling Integration

**Shared State:** Coordinates with table selection checkboxes and pagination
**Event Communication:** Communicates with confirmation dialogs and progress modals
**Data Sharing:** Shares operation results with table refresh and notification systems

### System Integration

**Global State:** Updates global state after bulk operations complete
**External Services:** Integrates with notification system, progress tracking, undo system
**Browser APIs:** Web Workers for client-side batch processing if supported

## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. **Item Selection:** User selects multiple items using checkboxes or selection methods
2. **Toolbar Activation:** Toolbar appears showing available bulk actions and selection count
3. **Action Selection:** User chooses appropriate bulk action from toolbar
4. **Confirmation:** System shows confirmation dialog for destructive actions
5. **Processing:** Bulk operation executes with progress feedback
6. **Completion:** Success message with operation summary, table updates

### Alternative Flows

**Select All Flow:** User selects all items on page or all items matching filter
**Progressive Selection:** User builds selection across multiple pages
**Action Cancellation:** User cancels long-running operation in progress

### Error Recovery Flows

**Partial Failure:** User reviews failed items, option to retry or manual resolution
**Permission Conflict:** User receives explanation of permission issues
**Validation Conflict:** User receives details of conflicting items, option to proceed with valid items

## Validation and Constraints

**Validation Feedback:** Disabled actions for incompatible selections

### Business Constraints

**Item State Requirements:** Bulk actions may require items to be in specific states
**Permission Requirements:** User must have appropriate permissions for all selected items
**Data Integrity Rules:** Bulk operations must maintain referential integrity

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Limits:** Maximum number of items that can be selected for bulk operations
**Browser Compatibility:** Progress tracking and long-running operation support
**Accessibility Requirements:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
