#### Session Initialization and Configuration
- **Trigger:** User initializes scanning session with selected device and configuration preferences
- **Processing:** Component establishes scanner connection, configures scan parameters, and validates session setup
- **Feedback:** Session startup progress, configuration confirmation, connection quality indicators
- **Validation:** Session parameters validated for device compatibility and scanning requirements
- **Error Handling:** Connection failures handled with retry mechanisms and troubleshooting guidance

#### Multi-user Session Coordination
- **Trigger:** Multiple users attempt to use scanners requiring session coordination and conflict resolution
- **Processing:** Component manages session allocation, prevents conflicts, and coordinates shared scanner resources
- **Feedback:** Session allocation status, user assignment indicators, conflict warnings, resource availability
- **Validation:** Session assignments validated against user permissions and device availability
- **Error Handling:** Session conflicts resolved with priority management and alternative device assignment

### Component Capabilities
- **Automatic Device Discovery:** Smart detection of HID barcode scanners with compatibility verification
