**User Experience:** Clear error feedback, recovery options if available
**Recovery:** User can retry action or dismiss error

## Data Integration

### Data Requirements

**Input Data:** Record data, user permissions, available actions configuration
**Data Format:** Record object with ID and state, permissions array, actions config
**Data Validation:** Validates record exists, permissions are current, actions are valid

### Data Processing

**Transformation:** Maps record state to available actions, filters by permissions
**Calculations:** Determines which actions are valid for current record state
**Filtering:** Removes actions user cannot perform or that don't apply to record

### Data Output

**Output Format:** Action execution requests, confirmation dialogs, navigation events
**Output Destination:** API endpoints, modal dialogs, navigation system
**Output Validation:** Ensures action requests are properly formatted and authorized

## API Integration

### Component-Specific API Calls

1. **DELETE /api/v1/equipment/{id}** (delete action)
   - **Trigger:** User clicks delete button and confirms
   - **Parameters:** Record ID in URL path
   - **Response Processing:** Success removes record from list, error shows message
   - **Error Scenarios:** 404 if record already deleted, 403 if no permission
   - **Loading Behavior:** Delete button shows spinner, other buttons disabled

2. **PUT /api/v1/equipment/{id}/archive** (archive action)
   - **Trigger:** User clicks archive button
   - **Parameters:** Record ID and archive reason
   - **Response Processing:** Success updates record state, error shows validation
   - **Error Scenarios:** Business rule violations, state conflicts
   - **Loading Behavior:** Archive button disabled during request

3. **POST /api/v1/equipment/{id}/duplicate** (copy action)
   - **Trigger:** User clicks copy/duplicate button
   - **Parameters:** Source record ID
   - **Response Processing:** Success creates new record, may navigate to edit
   - **Error Scenarios:** Validation errors, duplicate conflicts
   - **Loading Behavior:** Copy button shows loading state

### API Error Handling

**Network Errors:** Shows retry option, maintains button group state
**Server Errors:** Displays server error message, re-enables buttons
**Validation Errors:** Shows field-specific errors, allows correction
**Permission Errors:** Updates button group to reflect current permissions

## Component Integration

### Parent Integration

**Communication:** Parent provides record data and receives action events
**Dependencies:** Requires record context, user permissions, action configuration
**Events:** Sends 'actionExecuted', 'actionFailed', 'actionStarted' events

### Sibling Integration

**Shared State:** May share selection state with other list components
**Event Communication:** Coordinates with selection controls for bulk operations
**Data Sharing:** Uses shared record data and permission information

### System Integration

**Global State:** Uses global user permissions and application configuration
**External Services:** Integrates with action APIs, confirmation dialogs, navigation
**Browser APIs:** Uses clipboard API for copy actions, history API for navigation

## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. **Record Identification:** User identifies record they want to act upon
2. **Action Selection:** User reviews available actions in button group
3. **Action Execution:** User clicks desired action button
4. **Confirmation (if needed):** User confirms destructive actions
5. **Action Completion:** User sees results of action, interface updates

### Alternative Flows

**Bulk Action Flow:** User selects multiple records, uses bulk action buttons
**Dropdown Flow:** User accesses less common actions through dropdown menu
**Error Recovery Flow:** User retries failed actions or corrects validation errors

### Error Recovery Flows

**Permission Error:** User sees disabled buttons, understands access limitations
**Network Error:** User retries action after connectivity restored
**Business Rule Error:** User sees error explanation, may modify approach

## Validation and Constraints

### Input Validation

**Record State Validation:** Actions only available for appropriate record states
**Permission Validation:** User must have required permissions for each action
**Business Rule Validation:** Actions must comply with business constraints

### Business Constraints

**Workflow Rules:** Actions must follow defined business workflows
**Dependency Rules:** Cannot delete records with active dependencies
**State Constraints:** Some actions only available in specific record states

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Limits:** Button group must render within 100ms
**Browser Compatibility:** All actions must work across supported browsers
**Accessibility Requirements:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
**Mobile Compatibility:** Button group must work on touch devices
