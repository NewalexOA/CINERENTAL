## API Integration

### Component-Specific API Calls

1. **GET /api/v1/equipment?query={search_term}**
   - **Trigger:** User input after debounce delay or Enter key press
   - **Parameters:**
     - `query`: URL-encoded search term
     - `limit`: Number of results to return
     - `page`: Current page number for pagination
   - **Response Processing:** Equipment array processed for display in results table
   - **Error Scenarios:** Network timeouts, server errors, invalid parameters
   - **Loading Behavior:** Search field shows loading indicator, previous results remain visible

### API Error Handling

**Network Errors:** Connection timeout displays "Check internet connection" with retry button
**Server Errors:** 500/502 errors show "Search temporarily unavailable" with retry option
**Validation Errors:** 400 errors display specific validation messages from server
**Timeout Handling:** Requests timeout after 10 seconds, user gets retry option

## Component Integration

### Parent Integration

**Communication:** Sends search events to parent Equipment Search Section
**Dependencies:** Relies on parent for API configuration and error handling coordination
**Events:** Emits 'search-initiated', 'search-completed', 'search-error' events to parent

### Sibling Integration

**Shared State:** Search results affect Category Filter and Status Filter components
**Event Communication:** Search events trigger filter reset or state synchronization
**Data Sharing:** Search query shared with URL state management for bookmarking

### System Integration

**Global State:** Search terms may be stored in global state for cross-page persistence
**External Services:** Integrates with equipment database via REST API
**Browser APIs:** Uses URL API for search parameter persistence in browser history

## User Experience Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. **Initial Focus:** User clicks into search field, placeholder text dims
2. **Text Entry:** User types equipment name or barcode, debounce timer starts
3. **Search Execution:** API call triggered after debounce, loading indicator appears
4. **Results Display:** Equipment table updates with filtered results
5. **Search Refinement:** User modifies search term, process repeats

### Alternative Flows

**Barcode Entry:** User types/scans barcode, immediate exact match search executed
**Quick Search:** User presses Enter to bypass debounce for immediate search
**Search Clearing:** User clears field, full equipment list restored

### Error Recovery Flows

**Network Error:** User clicks retry button to repeat last search with same terms
**No Results:** User modifies search terms or clears search to see full list
**Invalid Input:** User receives guidance on valid search formats and character limits

## Validation and Constraints

### Input Validation

**Minimum Length:** Search requires 2-3 characters minimum to prevent excessive API calls
**Maximum Length:** Search terms limited to 100 characters to prevent abuse
**Character Filtering:** Special characters sanitized, SQL injection prevention
**Validation Timing:** Validation occurs on input and before API calls
**Validation Feedback:** Real-time character count, invalid character notifications

### Business Constraints

**Search Scope:** Limited to active equipment only unless admin user
**Rate Limiting:** Maximum 10 searches per minute per user to prevent API abuse
**Permission Checking:** Search results filtered based on user access permissions

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Limits:** Debounce prevents more than 2 API calls per second
**Browser Compatibility:** Uses standard input events, compatible with all modern browsers
**Accessibility Requirements:** ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Playwright Research Results

### Interactive Testing Notes

**User Interaction Results:** Search field responds immediately to input, debouncing works as expected
**State Transition Testing:** Smooth transitions between default, active, loading, and result states
**Data Input Testing:** Handles various input types including special characters and barcodes

### API Monitoring Results

**Network Activity:** GET requests to /api/v1/equipment with query parameters observed
**Performance Observations:** API response times average 200-400ms for typical searches
**Error Testing Results:** Network failures handled gracefully with clear user feedback

### Integration Testing Results

**Parent Communication:** Search events properly propagate to Equipment Search Section
**Sibling Interaction:** Search results properly trigger updates in filter components
**System Integration:** Search parameters correctly integrated with URL for bookmarking

### Edge Case Findings

**Boundary Testing:** Very long search terms truncated to 100 characters
**Error Condition Testing:** Network failures, empty results, and invalid input handled properly
**Race Condition Testing:** Rapid typing does not cause multiple concurrent API calls
