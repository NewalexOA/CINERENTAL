# TASK-004: Equipment Detail Page Analysis

## Page Overview

**Business Purpose:** Individual equipment item management with detailed information, history tracking, and status management
**Target Users:** Warehouse Staff (status updates), Rental Managers (equipment planning), Booking Coordinators (availability checking)
**Page URL:** `http://localhost:8000/equipment/{id}`
**Template File:** `/frontend/templates/equipment/detail.html`
**JavaScript File:** `/frontend/static/js/equipment-detail.js`

## üîç MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT RESEARCH

**CRITICAL:** Use MCP Playwright to interactively explore the equipment detail page:

### Research Steps

1. **Page Access:**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to specific equipment detail page
   # Test with multiple equipment IDs from http://localhost:8000/equipment list
   ```

2. **Interactive Testing:**
   - Load equipment detail page and observe all displayed information
   - Test equipment editing/update functionality
   - Change equipment status and observe workflow
   - Test barcode re-generation if available
   - Check equipment history or rental timeline
   - Test availability checking with date ranges
   - Try equipment deletion or archiving operations
   - Test any maintenance or notes functionality

3. **State Documentation:**
   - Capture loading states during data fetch and updates
   - Trigger and document error scenarios (equipment not found, update failures)
   - Test empty states (no rental history, no notes)
   - Record success confirmations for update operations

4. **API Monitoring:**
   - Monitor Network tab during equipment detail loading
   - Document equipment update API calls
   - Record status change API requests
   - Track availability checking API calls
   - Note any file upload or image management calls

5. **User Flow Testing:**
   - Test complete equipment management workflows
   - Navigate from equipment list and back
   - Test equipment status transition workflows
   - Verify integration with booking/rental systems
   - Test equipment maintenance scheduling if available
