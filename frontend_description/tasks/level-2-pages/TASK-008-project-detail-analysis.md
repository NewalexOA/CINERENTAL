# TASK-008: Project Detail/View Page Analysis

## Page Overview

**Business Purpose:** Individual project management with equipment booking, timeline management, and rental coordination
**Target Users:** Rental Managers (project oversight), Booking Coordinators (equipment booking), Warehouse Staff (equipment preparation)
**Page URL:** `http://localhost:8000/projects/{id}`
**Template File:** `/frontend/templates/projects/view.html`
**JavaScript Files:** `/frontend/static/js/project/project-equipment.js`, `/frontend/static/js/project/cart/index.js`, `/frontend/static/js/universal-cart/universal-cart.js`

## üîç MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT RESEARCH

**CRITICAL:** Use MCP Playwright to interactively explore the project detail page:

### Research Steps

1. **Page Access:**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to specific project detail page
   # Test with multiple project IDs from http://localhost:8000/projects list
   ```

2. **Interactive Testing:**
   - Load project detail page and observe all displayed information
   - Test equipment booking functionality and universal cart integration
   - Test equipment search and availability checking within project
   - Use barcode scanner integration for equipment addition
   - Test project information editing and updates
   - Test project status changes and workflow progression
   - Check equipment list management (add, remove, modify quantities)
   - Test document generation or printing features
   - Test project timeline and date modifications

3. **State Documentation:**
   - Capture loading states during data fetch and equipment operations
   - Trigger and document error scenarios (project not found, equipment conflicts)
   - Test empty states (no equipment booked, new project)
   - Record success confirmations for booking and update operations

4. **API Monitoring:**
   - Monitor Network tab during project loading and equipment operations
   - Document equipment search and availability API calls
   - Record universal cart API integrations
   - Track project update and status change API requests
   - Note barcode scanning and equipment lookup API calls

5. **User Flow Testing:**
   - Test complete equipment booking workflows
   - Navigate from projects list and back
   - Test project editing and status management workflows
   - Verify integration with universal cart system
   - Test barcode scanner equipment addition workflows
