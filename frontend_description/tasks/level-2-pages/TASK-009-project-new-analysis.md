# TASK-009: New Project Creation Page Analysis

## Page Overview

**Business Purpose:** Create new rental projects with client selection, date configuration, and initial setup
**Target Users:** Rental Managers (project planning), Booking Coordinators (new booking creation)
**Page URL:** `http://localhost:8000/projects/new`
**Template File:** `/frontend/templates/projects/new.html`
**JavaScript Files:** `/frontend/static/js/projects-new.js`, `/frontend/static/js/project/project-form.js`

## üîç MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT RESEARCH

**CRITICAL:** Use MCP Playwright to interactively explore the project creation page:

### Research Steps

1. **Page Access:**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to new project creation at http://localhost:8000/projects/new
   ```

2. **Interactive Testing:**
   - Load the project creation page and observe form structure
   - Test client selection functionality (dropdown, search, new client creation)
   - Test project date selection and validation (start/end dates, conflicts)
   - Test project information fields (name, description, notes)
   - Test form validation with various input scenarios
   - Test project creation submission and workflow
   - Test form reset and cancel operations
   - Test any templates or quick-start options
   - Verify navigation and integration patterns

3. **State Documentation:**
   - Capture loading states during client loading and form operations
   - Trigger and document error scenarios (validation failures, creation errors)
   - Test empty states (no clients available, form reset)
   - Record success confirmations and redirect behavior

4. **API Monitoring:**
   - Monitor Network tab during client list loading
   - Document project creation API calls
   - Record form validation API requests
   - Track any date conflict checking API calls
   - Note redirect patterns after successful creation

5. **User Flow Testing:**
   - Test complete project creation workflows
   - Navigate from projects list and verify return paths
   - Test client creation integration if available
   - Verify post-creation navigation to project detail
   - Test form abandonment and recovery scenarios

## Core Functionality Analysis Required

### Data Display

- **Primary Data:** Form fields for project creation, client selection options
- **Data Source:** GET /api/v1/clients for client dropdown, form templates
- **Data Structure:** Project creation form, client list, validation rules

### User Operations

#### Project Information Entry

- **Purpose:** Enter basic project details (name, description, notes)
- **User Actions:** Fill text fields, enter project metadata
- **API Integration:** Form validation, project name uniqueness checking
- **Validation:** Required fields, character limits, format validation
- **Success State:** Form fields validated, ready for submission
- **Error Handling:** Field validation errors, format issues

#### Client Selection

- **Purpose:** Select or create client for the project
- **User Actions:** Choose from dropdown, search clients, create new client
- **API Integration:** GET /api/v1/clients, POST /api/v1/clients (if creation enabled)
- **Validation:** Client selection required, client existence validation
- **Success State:** Client selected, client details displayed
- **Error Handling:** No clients available, client selection errors

#### Date Configuration

- **Purpose:** Set project start and end dates with conflict checking
- **User Actions:** Select dates, validate date range, check for conflicts
- **API Integration:** Date conflict checking against existing projects
- **Validation:** Date range logic, future dates, minimum duration
- **Success State:** Valid date range selected, no conflicts found
- **Error Handling:** Invalid date ranges, date conflicts, past dates

#### Project Creation Submission

- **Purpose:** Submit complete project creation form
- **User Actions:** Review form data, submit creation request
- **API Integration:** POST /api/v1/projects with form data
- **Validation:** Complete form validation, final conflict checking
- **Success State:** Project created, redirect to project detail page
- **Error Handling:** Creation failures, validation errors, server errors

### Interactive Elements

#### Project Information Form

- **Functionality:** Basic project data entry
- **Behavior:** Real-time validation, field dependencies
- **API Calls:** Validation requests, name uniqueness checking
- **States:** Empty form, filling form, validating, valid, invalid

#### Client Selection Interface

- **Functionality:** Client selection or creation
- **Behavior:** Dropdown with search, client creation modal/form
- **API Calls:** GET /api/v1/clients, POST /api/v1/clients
- **States:** Loading clients, clients loaded, client selected, creating client

#### Date Picker Component

- **Functionality:** Project date range selection
- **Behavior:** Start/end date selection, range validation, conflict checking
- **API Calls:** Date conflict checking API requests
- **States:** No dates, start date, date range, checking conflicts, conflicts found

#### Form Submission Controls

- **Functionality:** Form submission, reset, and cancel operations
- **Behavior:** Submit validation, form reset, navigation controls
- **API Calls:** Project creation POST request
- **States:** Form ready, submitting, submitted, submission error

## Expected Analysis Areas

### Page States

#### Loading States

- Page loading with form initialization

- Date conflict errors
- Project creation failures

#### Empty States

- Empty form initial state
- No clients available
- Form reset state

#### Success States

- Form loaded successfully
- Client selected successfully
