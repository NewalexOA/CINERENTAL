- **Behavior:** Automatic version creation on updates, visual diff display, metadata preservation
- **Validation:** Version integrity checks, permission validation for rollback operations
- **Feedback:** Version timeline, change indicators, restoration confirmation

### Data Integration
- **Data Sources:** Document storage system, client records, user permissions, audit logs
- **API Endpoints:** GET/POST /api/v1/clients/{id}/documents, PUT /api/v1/documents/{id}, DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}
- **Data Processing:** File metadata extraction, thumbnail generation, full-text indexing for search
- **Data Output:** Structured document listings with metadata, access controls, and version information

## Section States

### Default State
Document grid showing all client documents, sorted by upload date, with standard view settings

### Active State
User uploading files, searching documents, or performing bulk operations with real-time progress updates

### Loading State
Document grid showing skeleton loaders, upload progress indicators, search spinner during queries

### Error State
Upload failures with specific error messages, network errors with retry options, permission denied warnings

### Success State
Documents successfully uploaded and categorized, search results displayed, operations completed with confirmation

### Empty State
No documents uploaded yet, encouraging message with prominent upload area and getting-started guidance

## API Integration Details

### Section-Specific API Calls
1. **GET /api/v1/clients/{id}/documents**
   - **Trigger:** Section load, refresh actions, filter/search changes
   - **Parameters:** client_id (UUID), category (string), search (string), page (int), limit (int)
   - **Response Handling:** Populates document grid with metadata and thumbnails
   - **Error Handling:** Shows connection error, maintains cached documents when possible

2. **POST /api/v1/clients/{id}/documents**
   - **Trigger:** File upload completion, batch upload processing
   - **Parameters:** client_id (UUID), files (multipart), category (string), tags (array)
   - **Response Handling:** Updates document grid with new entries, shows success confirmation
   - **Error Handling:** Displays upload errors per file, allows retry for failed uploads

3. **PUT /api/v1/documents/{id}**
   - **Trigger:** Document metadata updates, permission changes, category reassignment
   - **Parameters:** document_id (UUID), name (string), category (string), permissions (object)
   - **Response Handling:** Updates document display with new metadata
   - **Error Handling:** Shows validation errors, reverts changes on failure

4. **DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id}**
   - **Trigger:** Document deletion confirmation
   - **Parameters:** document_id (UUID), permanent (boolean)
   - **Response Handling:** Removes document from grid, shows deletion confirmation
   - **Error Handling:** Permission errors, dependency warnings before deletion

### Data Flow
Upload → Validation → Storage → Metadata extraction → Grid update → Search indexing → Access control application

## Integration with Page
- **Dependencies:** Client record for association, user permissions for access control, storage service for files
- **Effects:** Updates client document count, affects compliance status indicators, triggers workflow notifications
- **Communication:** Shares document metrics with client overview, integrates with contract generation workflows

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. User navigates to client documents tab
2. System loads existing document grid with categories and metadata
3. User uploads new documents via drag-and-drop or browse button
4. System validates, processes, and categorizes uploaded files
5. Documents appear in grid with proper organization and access controls

### Alternative Flows
- User searches for specific documents using text search and filters
- User organizes documents into custom folders and applies bulk tags
- User shares documents with external parties via secure links
- User manages document versions and restores previous versions when needed

### Error Recovery
- Upload failures show specific error messages with retry options
- Network interruptions preserve partial uploads and allow resumption
- Permission errors provide clear explanations and alternative access methods

## Playwright Research Results

### Functional Testing Notes
- Drag-and-drop upload works reliably with visual feedback and progress tracking
- Document grid properly displays thumbnails and metadata with responsive layout
- Search functionality includes full-text search within PDF documents
- Permission controls properly restrict access based on user roles and document sensitivity

### State Transition Testing
- Upload states show progress accurately and handle interruptions gracefully
- Loading states provide appropriate feedback without blocking other operations
- Error states give specific guidance for resolution and recovery

### Integration Testing Results
- Document uploads properly associate with client records and update related metrics
- Search integration works across document content and metadata fields
- Version control maintains document integrity and provides reliable rollback

### Edge Case Findings
- Large file uploads handle properly with chunked upload and resume capability
- Special characters in filenames are properly encoded and displayed
- Concurrent document operations are handled without conflicts or data loss
- Browser refresh during uploads preserves progress and allows completion

### API Monitoring Results
- Upload requests properly handle multipart form data with progress tracking
- Search queries are optimized with proper indexing and response caching
- Document access requests include proper security tokens and audit logging
- Batch operations are properly queued to avoid server overload
