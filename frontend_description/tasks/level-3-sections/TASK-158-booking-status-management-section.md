### Data Flow
Status change request → Validation processing → Workflow checking → Authorization verification → Status update → Notification triggering → Audit logging

## Integration with Page
- **Dependencies:** Booking records for status context, workflow definitions for transition rules, user permissions for authorization
- **Effects:** Updates booking state affecting equipment availability and project timelines
- **Communication:** Integrates with project management, triggers contract generation, affects operational workflows

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. Operations staff accesses booking status management for lifecycle tracking
2. System displays current booking status with available transition options
3. Staff selects appropriate status transition and provides required justification
4. System validates transition eligibility and checks business rule compliance
5. Staff completes any required documentation and obtains necessary authorization
6. System updates booking status and triggers automated workflow actions
7. System sends notifications to stakeholders and logs change for audit

### Alternative Flows
- Automated system triggers status changes based on scheduled events or external system updates
- Staff performs bulk status updates for multiple bookings with coordinated validation
- Manager overrides status transition restrictions with proper authorization and justification
- System escalates status change delays to appropriate management levels

### Error Recovery
- Status validation failures provide specific correction guidance and alternative options
- Bulk operation errors allow individual booking correction and partial completion
- Authorization failures offer alternative approval workflows and escalation paths
- System errors provide rollback capabilities and manual status correction tools
