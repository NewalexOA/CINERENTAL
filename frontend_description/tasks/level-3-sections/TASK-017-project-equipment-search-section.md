# TASK-017: Project Equipment Search Section Analysis

## Section Overview

**Parent Page:** Project Detail/View Page
**Section Purpose:** Equipment discovery and availability checking within project date context for cart addition
**Page URL:** `http://localhost:8000/projects/{id}`
**Section Location:** Equipment search area within project page, typically above or alongside equipment cart section

## üîç MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT RESEARCH

**CRITICAL:** Use MCP Playwright to interactively test the project equipment search section:

### Research Steps

1. **Section Location:**

   ```bash
   # Open project detail page in Playwright

   - Apply category filters within search results
   - Test availability checking against project dates
   - Add equipment directly to cart from search results
   - Test barcode scanner integration for equipment lookup
   - Verify search results pagination if applicable
   - Test search result sorting and filtering options

3. **State Observation:**
   - Document initial search state with guidance messaging
   - Observe search loading states during API calls
   - Record empty search results state
   - Test search error states (API failures, invalid input)
   - Observe availability conflict warnings in results

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test search integration with project date context
   - Verify search results availability checking accuracy
   - Test seamless cart addition from search results
   - Check search state preservation during cart operations
   - Test search reset when project dates change

5. **API Monitoring:**
   - Monitor equipment search API calls with project context
   - Document availability checking API requests
   - Record cart addition API calls from search results
   - Track barcode lookup API integration

6. **Edge Case Testing:**
   - Test search with project dates that conflict with equipment availability
   - Test search during equipment status changes
   - Test search with invalid or expired project dates
   - Test search performance with large equipment databases

Search input ‚Üí Equipment API with project dates ‚Üí Availability checking ‚Üí Results display ‚Üí Cart addition ‚Üí Cart state update

## Integration with Page

- **Dependencies:** Requires project date context, integrates with universal cart system
- **Effects:** Provides equipment for cart addition, affects project booking availability
- **Communication:** Sends equipment to cart, receives project date updates

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. User enters equipment search terms in project context
2. System returns equipment available for project dates
3. User reviews availability indicators for each result
4. User adds desired equipment directly to cart from results
5. Search results update to show items added to cart

### Alternative Flows

- Scanner-first search: User scans barcodes for immediate equipment lookup
- Category-filtered search: User selects categories first, then searches within them
- Availability-focused search: User specifically looks for equipment with availability conflicts
- Bulk addition: User adds multiple equipment items rapidly from search results

### Error Recovery

- Search failures: User can retry search or modify search terms
- Availability conflicts: User can modify project dates or choose alternative equipment
- Cart addition failures: User gets error feedback and can retry addition
- Scanner issues: User can fall back to manual equipment name search
