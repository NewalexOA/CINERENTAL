# TASK-025: Project New Form Section Analysis

## Section Overview

**Parent Page:** Project Creation Page
**Section Purpose:** Project creation form with client selection, date range input, and project initialization
**Page URL:** `http://localhost:8000/projects/new`
**Section Location:** Main form area for new project creation with client and timeline configuration

## üîç MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT RESEARCH

**CRITICAL:** Use MCP Playwright to interactively test the project new form section:

### Research Steps

1. **Section Location:**

   ```bash
   # Open project creation page at http://localhost:8000/projects/new in Playwright
   # Identify project creation form fields and controls
   # Locate client selection, date inputs, project details form
   # Test form validation and submission process
   ```

2. **Functional Testing:**
   - Fill out project name and description fields
   - Test client selection dropdown or search functionality
   - Input project start and end dates using date pickers
   - Test form validation for required fields and data validation
   - Submit form and verify project creation process
   - Test form reset and clear functionality
   - Check form auto-save or draft functionality if available

3. **State Observation:**
   - Document empty form state with field guidance
   - Observe form validation states (valid, invalid, pending)
   - Record form submission loading states
   - Test form error states for validation failures
   - Observe form success states after project creation

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test form integration with client management system
   - Verify date validation against business rules
   - Test form submission integration with project creation API
   - Check form integration with equipment booking workflows

5. **API Monitoring:**
   - Monitor client lookup API calls for selection
   - Document project creation API requests and responses
   - Record form validation API calls if server-side
   - Track navigation API calls after successful creation

6. **Edge Case Testing:**
   - Test form with invalid date ranges
   - Test form with non-existent or restricted clients
   - Test form submission during network connectivity issues
   - Test form with very long project names or descriptions

### Data Integration

- **Data Sources:** Client management API, project creation API, date validation services
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/v1/clients` for client selection options
  - `POST /api/v1/projects` for project creation
  - Date validation services for timeline checking
- **Data Processing:** Form data validation, client relationship establishment, project initialization
- **Data Output:** New project data, client assignment, timeline configuration

## Section States

### Default State

Empty form with all fields ready for input, client selection available, date pickers functional

### Filling State

Form partially completed with some fields filled, validation feedback active

### Validating State

Form validation in progress, fields showing validation status, submit button state appropriate

### Submitting State

Form submission in progress, fields disabled, loading indicators active, success pending

### Success State

## API Integration Details

### Section-Specific API Calls

1. **GET /api/v1/clients**
   - **Trigger:** Client selection field activation, client search input
   - **Parameters:**
     - `search`: Optional search terms for client filtering
     - `active_only`: Filter for active clients only
   - **Response Handling:** Client options populated in selection interface
   - **Error Handling:** Client loading errors with fallback to manual input

2. **POST /api/v1/projects**

### Data Flow

Form input ‚Üí Client selection ‚Üí Date configuration ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Project creation API ‚Üí Success redirection

## Integration with Page

- **Dependencies:** Requires client management system, integrates with project management workflow
- **Effects:** Creates new project entity, establishes client relationship, enables equipment booking
- **Communication:** Sends new project data to system, triggers navigation to project detail

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. User opens new project form from projects list or dashboard
2. User enters project name and description
3. User selects client from available client list
4. User sets project start and end dates
5. User submits form and is redirected to new project detail page

### Alternative Flows

- Client-first workflow: User selects client first, then configures project details
- Template-based creation: User starts from project template with pre-filled values
- Draft saving: User saves partial form as draft and returns later to complete
- Validation-focused workflow: User receives validation feedback and corrects errors

### Error Recovery

- Validation errors: User gets field-specific error feedback and can correct issues
- Client selection issues: User can search for different client or request new client creation
- Date validation problems: User gets guidance on valid date ranges and business rules
- Submission failures: User can retry submission or save as draft

## Playwright Research Results

### Functional Testing Notes

- Form should provide clear guidance for required vs optional fields
- Client selection should be efficient with search and filtering capabilities
- Date validation should be comprehensive with clear business rule enforcement
- Form submission should provide appropriate loading feedback and success confirmation

### State Transition Testing

- Test empty ‚Üí filling ‚Üí validating ‚Üí submitting ‚Üí success state flow
- Verify validation state transitions work correctly with field-level feedback
- Test error recovery from validation failures to corrected states
- Verify form reset functionality returns to proper default state

### Integration Testing Results

- Form should integrate seamlessly with client management system
- Project creation should properly establish all necessary relationships
- Date validation should work with equipment availability system
- Form submission should provide smooth transition to project detail page

### Edge Case Findings

- Very long project names should be handled with appropriate truncation or validation
- Client selection should handle cases where user has limited client access
- Date ranges should validate against business calendar and availability constraints
- Network failures during submission should provide appropriate retry mechanisms

### API Monitoring Results

- Client selection should be responsive with efficient search capabilities
- Project creation should be atomic to prevent partial project creation
- Form validation should minimize server round trips while ensuring accuracy
- Error responses should provide specific guidance for form correction

### Screenshot References

- Filled form state: Partially completed form showing validation feedback
- Client selection state: Client selection interface with search results
- Date picker state: Date range selection with calendar interface
- Validation error state: Form showing validation errors with correction guidance
