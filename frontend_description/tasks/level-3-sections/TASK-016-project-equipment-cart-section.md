## Integration with Page

- **Dependencies:** Requires project context for availability checking, integrates with equipment search
- **Effects:** Cart checkout updates project equipment list, affects equipment availability
- **Communication:** Receives equipment from search/scanner, sends booking data to project

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. User searches for equipment or scans barcodes to find items
2. Equipment items added to cart with default quantities
3. User reviews cart contents and adjusts quantities as needed
4. User checks equipment availability and resolves any conflicts
5. User proceeds to checkout to book all cart items to project

### Alternative Flows

- Bulk addition: User adds multiple equipment items rapidly via scanner
- Quantity planning: User adds items then carefully adjusts quantities based on needs
- Availability management: User resolves availability conflicts before checkout
- Cart persistence: User builds cart over multiple sessions, cart state preserved

### Error Recovery

- Addition failures: User gets clear error messages and can retry
- Availability conflicts: User can modify quantities or remove items
- Checkout failures: User gets detailed failure reasons and resolution steps
- Network issues: Cart operations queue and retry when connection restored

## Playwright Research Results
