- **Effects:** Modifies system behavior globally, affects all user experiences, triggers system-wide updates
- **Communication:** Integrates with all system components, affects operational workflows, feeds into monitoring systems

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. System administrator accesses settings management for system configuration
2. System displays setting categories with current configuration values
3. Administrator navigates to specific setting category and reviews current values
4. Administrator modifies setting values with appropriate validation feedback
5. System validates changes and assesses impact on dependent systems
6. Administrator confirms changes and system applies configuration updates
7. System logs changes and notifies affected users of configuration updates

### Alternative Flows
- Administrator creates custom business rules for specific operational requirements
- Administrator configures external system integrations with credential management
- Administrator reviews change history and performs selective rollback operations
- Administrator tests configuration changes in sandbox environment before production

### Error Recovery
- Configuration validation errors provide specific correction guidance and alternative values
- Integration failures offer connection troubleshooting and credential verification tools
- Rollback operations include impact warnings and partial rollback capabilities
- System errors provide recovery mechanisms and manual configuration override options
