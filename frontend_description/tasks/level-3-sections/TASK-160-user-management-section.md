- **Communication:** Integrates with all system components requiring user authentication and authorization

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. System administrator accesses user management for account administration
2. System displays user directory with current accounts and their status
3. Administrator searches or filters users to locate specific accounts for management
4. Administrator selects user and accesses profile editor for account modifications
5. Administrator updates user information, roles, or permissions with validation feedback
6. System applies changes and recalculates user permissions across all systems
7. Administrator reviews security dashboard and activity logs for compliance verification

### Alternative Flows
- Administrator creates new user accounts with role assignment and welcome workflow
- Administrator performs bulk operations for user status changes or role assignments
- Administrator investigates security events and user activities for compliance or security purposes
- Administrator tests user access permissions to verify proper security configuration

### Error Recovery
- User validation errors provide specific correction guidance and data preservation
- Permission conflicts offer resolution suggestions and manual override capabilities
- Security alerts provide investigation tools and response action options
- System errors include rollback capabilities and manual user management tools
