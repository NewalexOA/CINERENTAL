- **Feedback:** Loading indicators during navigation, current position markers, activity density visualization

#### Activity Type Filters
- **Function:** Filter timeline by specific activity categories for focused analysis
- **Input:** Multi-select checkboxes for rentals, payments, communications, system events, and custom categories
- **Behavior:** Real-time filtering with visual count indicators and applied filter badges
- **Validation:** Only valid activity types selectable from available categories
- **Feedback:** Filter count display, "no results" messaging for empty filter combinations

#### Timeline Search
- **Function:** Text-based search within activity descriptions, notes, and related record data
- **Input:** Search text with minimum 2 characters, search across activity content and metadata
- **Behavior:** Debounced search with highlighting, search suggestion dropdown
- **Validation:** Search terms sanitized for security, special characters handled properly
- **Feedback:** Search result count, highlighted matching terms, search history suggestions

#### Activity Export
- **Function:** Generate comprehensive activity reports for external analysis or compliance
- **Input:** Export button with current filter and date range settings
- **Behavior:** Server-side report generation with multiple format options (PDF, CSV, Excel)
- **Validation:** Requires at least one activity in current filter set
- **Feedback:** Export progress indicator, download prompt, format selection dialog

#### Related Record Navigation
- **Function:** Navigate directly to related records from timeline activities
- **Input:** Click on linked equipment, projects, invoices, or contracts within activity entries
- **Behavior:** Opens related records in new tab or modal overlay, maintains timeline context
- **Validation:** User permissions validated for accessing related records
- **Feedback:** Visual link indicators, hover previews, breadcrumb navigation

### Data Integration
- **Data Sources:** Rental records, payment transactions, communication logs, system audit trails, document activities
- **API Endpoints:** GET /api/v1/clients/{id}/timeline, GET /api/v1/activities/search, POST /api/v1/activities/export
- **Data Processing:** Activity aggregation with intelligent grouping, duplicate detection, relevance scoring
- **Data Output:** Chronologically ordered activity stream with enriched metadata and relationship data

## Section States

### Default State
Timeline loaded with recent activities (last 90 days), all activity types visible, sorted chronologically

### Active State
User scrolling timeline, expanding activities, or applying filters with real-time updates

### Loading State
Timeline skeleton during initial load, expanding activity spinners, filter application progress

### Error State
Timeline load errors with retry options, partial data display when some sources unavailable

### Success State
Complete timeline populated, activities expanded successfully, export generation completed

### Empty State
No activities found for current filters, helpful guidance for adjusting filters or date range

## API Integration Details

### Section-Specific API Calls
1. **GET /api/v1/clients/{id}/timeline**
   - **Trigger:** Section load, date navigation, filter changes, pagination

   - **Error Handling:** Shows connection errors, gracefully handles partial data availability

2. **GET /api/v1/activities/{id}/details**
   - **Trigger:** Activity expansion, detail view requests
   - **Parameters:** activity_id (UUID), include_related (boolean)
   - **Response Handling:** Loads detailed activity data with related record information
   - **Error Handling:** Shows "details unavailable" message, maintains basic activity display

3. **GET /api/v1/activities/search**
   - **Trigger:** Search input with debounce delay, advanced search submissions
   - **Parameters:** client_id (UUID), query (string), types (array), date_range (object)
   - **Response Handling:** Updates timeline with search results and highlighted terms

4. **POST /api/v1/activities/export**
   - **Trigger:** Export button with current timeline state and filters
   - **Parameters:** client_id (UUID), filters (object), format (string), date_range (object)
   - **Response Handling:** Initiates report generation and download
   - **Error Handling:** Shows generation errors, offers alternative formats or retry

### Data Flow
Timeline request → Activity aggregation → Chronological sorting → Timeline rendering → User interaction → Detail expansion → Related record resolution

## Integration with Page
- **Dependencies:** Client context for activity filtering, user permissions for sensitive activity access
- **Effects:** Provides comprehensive client interaction history, supports relationship analysis and pattern recognition
- **Communication:** Integrates with client overview metrics, feeds into client relationship scoring algorithms

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. User navigates to client activity timeline tab
2. System loads comprehensive activity history from all integrated sources
3. User scrolls through chronological timeline and expands relevant activities
4. User applies filters to focus on specific activity types or date ranges
5. User navigates to related records directly from timeline activities

### Alternative Flows
- User searches for specific activities using text search across timeline
- User exports filtered timeline for external reporting or compliance documentation
- User uses date navigation to jump to specific time periods in client history
- User expands activity groups to see individual events within clustered activities

### Error Recovery
- Timeline load errors provide retry mechanisms and display cached data when available
- Search failures maintain current timeline state and offer alternative search options
- Export errors provide format alternatives and retry capabilities with progress preservation

## Playwright Research Results

### Functional Testing Notes
- Timeline properly aggregates activities from multiple sources with accurate chronological ordering
- Activity expansion loads detailed information efficiently with proper error handling
- Filter combinations work correctly and provide meaningful activity subsets
- Search functionality includes comprehensive text matching across activity content

### State Transition Testing
- Loading states provide appropriate feedback during timeline population and activity expansion
