### Data Flow
Project data → Template selection → Merge field population → Customization → Validation → Generation → Storage → Download

## Integration with Page
- **Dependencies:** Project context for data population, client records for personalization, equipment details for specifications
- **Effects:** Updates project status to contract-ready, triggers notification workflows, affects project milestone completion
- **Communication:** Integrates with signature workflow, feeds into invoice generation, updates project timeline

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. User navigates to project contracts section after project confirmation
2. System suggests appropriate contract templates based on project characteristics
3. User selects template and reviews auto-populated merge fields
4. User customizes contract terms and adds project-specific clauses
5. System validates contract completeness and generates final PDF
6. User downloads contract and proceeds to signature workflow

### Alternative Flows
- User uploads custom contract template for project-specific requirements
- User compares multiple templates before making selection
- User saves contract draft for later completion and review
- User generates multiple contract versions for different scenarios

### Error Recovery
- Template selection errors provide alternative template suggestions
- Merge field errors allow manual data entry and correction
- Generation failures preserve customizations and offer retry with different settings
- Validation errors provide specific guidance for compliance resolution
