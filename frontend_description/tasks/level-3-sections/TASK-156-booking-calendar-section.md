## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. User navigates to booking calendar for equipment scheduling
2. System displays current calendar view with existing bookings and equipment availability
3. User drags equipment from side panel to calendar timeline to create new booking
4. System validates availability and highlights conflicts if any exist
5. User adjusts booking details and resolves any conflicts using suggested alternatives
6. System confirms booking creation and updates availability across calendar
7. Calendar refreshes to show updated booking schedule and availability status

### Alternative Flows
- User modifies existing bookings by dragging to new dates or resizing duration
- User creates recurring bookings with pattern specification and conflict resolution
- User views calendar in different time granularities (daily, weekly, monthly) for different planning needs
- User filters calendar by specific equipment categories or client projects

### Error Recovery
- Booking conflicts provide alternative date suggestions and automatic resolution options
- Drag operation failures revert bookings to original positions with clear error explanation
- Availability calculation errors provide conservative estimates and manual override options
- Calendar synchronization errors offer refresh options and offline mode capabilities
