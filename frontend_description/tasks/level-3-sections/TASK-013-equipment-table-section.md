   - Observe empty table state when no data
   - Record sorting states (ascending, descending, none)
   - Document selection states (none, partial, all selected)
   - Test error states (API failures, data corruption)

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Verify table updates when search/filter criteria change
   - Test pagination integration with table display
   - Check table interaction with bulk action controls
   - Test table refresh when equipment data changes

5. **API Monitoring:**
   - Monitor sorting API requests and parameters
   - Document table data loading and refresh calls
   - Record bulk operation API calls triggered from table
   - Track equipment detail navigation requests

6. **Edge Case Testing:**
   - Test table with very large datasets
   - Test table with missing/null equipment data
   - Test rapid clicking on sortable columns
   - Test table behavior during network connectivity issues

### Data Flow

Equipment API ‚Üí Table data processing ‚Üí Row rendering ‚Üí User interactions ‚Üí API updates ‚Üí Table refresh

## Integration with Page

- **Dependencies:** Receives filtered data from search section, integrates with pagination controls
- **Effects:** Provides selected equipment data to bulk operations, triggers navigation to detail pages
- **Communication:** Sends selection state to page, receives refresh signals from other components

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. User views loaded equipment table with default data
2. User clicks column header to sort data by that attribute
3. System re-fetches data with sort parameters and updates table
4. User selects equipment items using checkboxes for bulk operations
5. User clicks equipment name to navigate to detail page

### Alternative Flows

- Bulk selection: User uses "select all" to choose all visible items
- Status-based actions: User clicks on status-specific action buttons
- Direct navigation: User uses action buttons instead of name clicks
- Data refresh: User triggers manual table refresh after external changes

### Error Recovery

- Sort failure: User can try different columns or refresh table
- Selection issues: User can clear selection and retry
- Navigation errors: User gets error feedback and can retry
- Data loading errors: User can refresh page or retry load

## Playwright Research Results
