- **Output/Result:** Comprehensive communication history with timestamps, participants, and interaction types

#### Add Communication Entry
- **Purpose:** Record new client interactions manually for complete relationship tracking
- **User Interaction:** Modal form with communication type selection, participants, and message content
- **Processing Logic:** Validates entry data, associates with client record, triggers notification workflows
- **Output/Result:** New timeline entry with proper categorization and automatic timestamp

#### Communication Filtering
- **Purpose:** Focus on specific types of interactions or date ranges for targeted analysis
- **User Interaction:** Filter controls for communication type, date range, and participant selection
- **Processing Logic:** Client-side filtering of loaded communications with server-side pagination support
- **Output/Result:** Filtered timeline showing only matching communications with applied filter indicators

### Interactive Elements
#### Communication Timeline
- **Function:** Visual representation of client interaction history with expandable details
- **Input:** Click to expand entries, scroll for pagination, hover for quick preview
- **Behavior:** Lazy loading for large histories, smooth expansion animations, context menus
- **Validation:** Read-only display with edit permissions for authorized users only
- **Feedback:** Loading indicators for expanding entries, visual indicators for unread items

#### Add Entry Button
- **Function:** Trigger modal form for recording new client communication
- **Input:** Single click opens communication entry modal
- **Behavior:** Validates user permissions, pre-populates client context
- **Validation:** Requires minimum communication type and content
- **Feedback:** Button disabled during form submission, success message on save

#### Communication Type Filter
- **Function:** Filter timeline by interaction type (email, phone, meeting, system)
- **Input:** Multi-select dropdown with communication type categories
- **Behavior:** Real-time filtering with visual count indicators
- **Validation:** Only valid communication types selectable
- **Feedback:** Applied filters shown as removable badges

#### Date Range Selector
- **Function:** Filter communications within specific timeframe
- **Input:** Start date and end date via date picker components
- **Behavior:** Validates date logic, updates timeline dynamically
- **Validation:** End date must be after start date, future dates allowed for scheduled communications
- **Feedback:** Invalid date ranges show validation errors

#### Export Communications Button
- **Function:** Generate downloadable report of filtered communication history
- **Input:** Click triggers export with current filter settings
- **Behavior:** Server-side PDF/CSV generation with client communication data
- **Validation:** Requires at least one communication entry to export
- **Feedback:** Loading spinner during generation, download prompt on completion

### Data Integration
- **Data Sources:** Communications table, user records for participants, file attachments storage
- **API Endpoints:** GET /api/v1/clients/{id}/communications, POST /api/v1/communications, GET /api/v1/communications/export
- **Data Processing:** Timeline sorting, participant name resolution, attachment URL generation
- **Data Output:** Structured communication timeline with metadata and searchable content

## Section States

### Default State
Communication timeline loaded with recent entries, all filters cleared, showing last 30 days of activity

### Active State
User scrolling through timeline, expanding entries, or adjusting filters with real-time updates

### Loading State
Timeline skeleton showing during initial load, spinner for expanding entries, disabled controls during API calls

### Error State
API error message for failed loads, retry button available, graceful degradation for partial failures

### Success State
Timeline populated with communications, filters applied successfully, export generation completed

### Empty State
No communications found for current filters, helpful message encouraging first interaction recording

## API Integration Details

### Section-Specific API Calls
1. **GET /api/v1/clients/{id}/communications**
   - **Trigger:** Section load, filter changes, pagination, timeline refresh
   - **Parameters:** client_id (UUID), type (array), date_from (ISO), date_to (ISO), page (int), limit (int)
   - **Response Handling:** Populates timeline with communication entries, handles pagination
   - **Error Handling:** Shows connection error message, maintains cached data when possible

2. **POST /api/v1/communications**
   - **Trigger:** Add communication form submission
   - **Parameters:** client_id (UUID), type (enum), content (text), participants (array), attachments (files)
   - **Response Handling:** Adds new entry to timeline, closes modal form
   - **Error Handling:** Shows validation errors in form, prevents duplicate submissions

3. **GET /api/v1/communications/export**
   - **Trigger:** Export button click with current filter settings
   - **Parameters:** client_id (UUID), filters (object), format (pdf|csv)
   - **Response Handling:** Initiates file download, shows success notification
   - **Error Handling:** Shows generation error, offers retry or format change

### Data Flow
Timeline load → Communication display → Filter application → Server request → Timeline update → State persistence

## Integration with Page
- **Dependencies:** Client context for record association, user permissions for edit capabilities
- **Effects:** Updates client last-contact timestamp, triggers relationship scoring algorithms
- **Communication:** Shares communication metrics with client overview section, affects client status indicators

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow
1. User navigates to client detail page communication tab
2. System loads recent communication history chronologically
3. User reviews timeline and expands specific entries for details
4. User adds new communication entry via add button
5. System updates timeline with new entry and refreshes client metrics

### Alternative Flows
- User applies filters to find specific communication types or date ranges
- User exports communication history for external reporting or analysis
- User clicks on participants to view their communication history
- User uploads attachments as part of communication logging

### Error Recovery
- Failed timeline loads show retry button and cached data when available
- Communication entry failures preserve form data for correction and resubmission
- Export failures offer alternative format options and retry mechanisms
