- **Behavior:** Checkbox or dropdown selection, multiple statuses allowed
- **Validation:** Valid status value checking, status compatibility
- **Feedback:** Selected status indicators, visual status representation

#### Clear/Reset Button

- **Function:** Reset all search and filter criteria to default state
- **Input:** Single click action
- **Behavior:** Immediate clearing of all search parameters, trigger full list reload
- **Validation:** No validation required
- **Feedback:** Visual confirmation of reset, loading indicator during reload

### Data Integration

- **Data Sources:** Equipment database via search API, categories list, status enums
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/v1/equipment?query={search}&category_id={ids}&status={statuses}`
  - `GET /api/v1/categories` for filter options
- **Data Processing:** Search term sanitization, filter combination logic, result sorting and pagination
- **Data Output:** Filtered equipment list passed to equipment table section for display

## Section States

### Default State

Search input empty, all filters set to "All" or unselected, full equipment list displayed, search controls ready for input

### Active State

User typing in search field, search processing with debounce delay, loading indicator active, partial results may be shown

### Loading State

Search API call in progress, loading spinner or progress indicator shown, search input may be disabled, previous results still visible

### Error State

Search API failure, error message displayed near search controls, search input remains functional, option to retry search

### Success State

Search completed successfully, results displayed in equipment table, result count shown, search terms highlighted in results

### Empty State

## API Integration Details

### Section-Specific API Calls

1. **GET /api/v1/equipment**
   - **Trigger:** Text input in search field (debounced), filter selection, search button click
   - **Parameters:**
     - `query`: search text for name/barcode matching
     - `category_id`: array of selected category IDs
     - `status`: array of selected status values
     - `page`: current page number (for pagination integration)
     - `limit`: items per page setting
   - **Response Handling:** Equipment array processed and passed to table display, pagination metadata handled
   - **Error Handling:** Network errors show retry option, invalid parameters show validation messages

2. **GET /api/v1/categories**
   - **Trigger:** Page load to populate category filter options
   - **Parameters:** None (loads all active categories)
   - **Response Handling:** Category tree built for filter dropdown display
   - **Error Handling:** Filter falls back to text-only search if categories fail to load

### Data Flow

Search input ‚Üí Debounce timer ‚Üí API request with parameters ‚Üí Response processing ‚Üí Equipment table update ‚Üí Pagination adjustment

## Integration with Page

- **Dependencies:** Requires equipment table section for result display, pagination section for large result sets
- **Effects:** Controls equipment table content, affects pagination state, may trigger equipment count updates
- **Communication:** Sends search parameters to equipment table, receives feedback on result counts and states

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. User opens equipment page with full list displayed
2. User enters search term in search input field
3. System debounces input and triggers API search
4. Results displayed in equipment table below
5. User refines search with additional filters
6. System updates results based on combined criteria

### Alternative Flows

- Quick barcode search: User scans/types barcode for immediate equipment lookup
- Category-first filtering: User selects category filter first, then adds text search
- Status-based filtering: User filters by equipment status before text search
- Search reset: User clears all criteria to return to full list

### Error Recovery

- Network error: User can retry search with same criteria
- No results: User can modify search terms or clear filters
- Invalid search: User receives guidance on valid search formats
- API timeout: User can retry or refresh page to restore functionality

## Playwright Research Results

### Functional Testing Notes

- Search debouncing timing should be tested to ensure reasonable response time
- Multiple concurrent searches should be handled gracefully
- Search parameters should persist during page navigation
- Filter combinations should work logically without conflicts

### State Transition Testing

- Test transitions between empty ‚Üí loading ‚Üí results ‚Üí empty states
- Verify proper state cleanup when search is cleared
- Test state preservation during network interruptions
- Verify visual feedback during all state transitions

### Integration Testing Results

- Search section should properly control equipment table display
- Pagination should reset to page 1 when search criteria change
- Search parameters should integrate with URL for bookmarking/sharing
- Filter state should be preserved across browser sessions if configured

### Edge Case Findings

- Very long search terms should be handled gracefully
- Special characters in search should not break functionality
- Rapid typing should not cause multiple API calls
- Search should handle equipment with missing or null fields

### API Monitoring Results

- Search API calls should be optimized to avoid unnecessary requests
- Response times should be reasonable for typical search operations
- Error responses should provide actionable feedback to users
- Search parameters should be properly URL-encoded
