3. Manager investigates high-priority conflicts and reviews automated resolution suggestions
4. Manager selects appropriate resolution strategy and reviews impact assessment
5. System implements resolution and automatically notifies affected stakeholders
6. Manager monitors resolution effectiveness and stakeholder responses
7. System updates conflict status and provides lessons learned for future prevention

### Alternative Flows
- Automated system detects and resolves simple conflicts without human intervention
- Manager escalates complex conflicts to senior management with detailed impact reports
- Stakeholders respond to conflict notifications requiring additional coordination
- Manager schedules preventive measures based on conflict pattern analysis

### Error Recovery
- Detection failures trigger manual conflict scanning and alternative detection methods
- Resolution implementation errors provide rollback capabilities and manual override options
- Communication failures offer alternative notification channels and retry mechanisms
- Impact assessment errors provide conservative estimates and manual assessment tools
