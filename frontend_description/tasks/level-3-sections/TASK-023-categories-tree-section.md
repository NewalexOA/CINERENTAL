### Data Flow

Category hierarchy API ‚Üí Tree structure building ‚Üí Interactive tree rendering ‚Üí User operations ‚Üí Hierarchy updates ‚Üí Tree refresh

## Integration with Page

- **Dependencies:** Integrates with equipment categorization, search and filtering systems
- **Effects:** Category changes affect equipment organization, search filters, bulk operations
- **Communication:** Sends category changes to equipment system, receives category usage updates

## User Interaction Patterns

### Primary User Flow

1. User views category tree with organizational hierarchy
2. User expands relevant category branches for detailed view
3. User performs category management operations (add, edit, reorder)
4. System validates operations and updates tree structure
5. User sees updated category hierarchy with changes reflected

### Alternative Flows

- Reorganization workflow: User restructures category hierarchy through drag-drop
- Category cleanup: User consolidates or removes unused categories
- Search-focused navigation: User searches for specific categories within large trees
- Bulk category operations: User performs multiple category changes efficiently

### Error Recovery

- Tree loading failures: User can retry tree loading or refresh page
- Operation conflicts: User gets clear conflict resolution guidance
- Hierarchy validation errors: User gets specific guidance on valid hierarchy structures
- Network issues: User can queue operations for retry when connectivity restored

## Playwright Research Results

### Functional Testing Notes

- Category tree should provide intuitive hierarchy navigation
- Drag-drop reordering should have clear visual feedback and validation
- Category operations should respect equipment categorization constraints
- Tree performance should remain good with large category structures

### State Transition Testing

- Test tree expansion/collapse state preservation across operations
- Verify editing state transitions work smoothly with proper cancellation
- Test reordering state transitions with appropriate validation feedback
- Verify error state recovery to normal tree operation

### Integration Testing Results

- Category tree should integrate properly with equipment categorization system
- Tree changes should appropriately affect equipment filters and organization
- Category operations should maintain data consistency across the system
- Tree state should be preserved appropriately during navigation

### Edge Case Findings

- Very deep category hierarchies should be handled with performance considerations
- Categories with many equipment items should show appropriate usage warnings
- Long category names should be displayed appropriately within tree layout
- Circular hierarchy references should be prevented with clear validation

### API Monitoring Results

- Category hierarchy loading should be efficient with appropriate data structure
- Tree operations should be optimized to minimize unnecessary API calls
- Hierarchy validation should be comprehensive to prevent data inconsistencies
- Category usage tracking should provide accurate equipment count information
