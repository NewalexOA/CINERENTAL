## Frontend Integration

### API Call Implementation

**Location:** `/frontend/static/js/equipment/equipment-bookings.js`
**Function/Method:** `loadEquipmentBookings()`, `filterBookingHistory()`, `checkEquipmentAvailability()`
**Call Pattern:** Promise-based GET request with filtering and utilization analysis

### Error Handling

#### Network Errors
**Detection:** Request timeouts during booking history loading
**User Feedback:** "Unable to load booking history - check connection"
**Recovery:** Cached booking data if available, retry mechanism

#### Server Errors
**Error Processing:** Equipment not found handled gracefully
**Error Display:** Booking history unavailable message
**Error Recovery:** Alternative equipment selection, history refresh

### Loading States

**Loading Indicators:** Booking history loading skeleton, utilization chart loading
**Expected Duration:** 400ms-1.5s depending on booking history size
**Progress Indication:** Progressive loading for extensive booking histories

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times
**Typical Response Time:** 400ms-1s for booking histories, up to 2s with extensive utilization analysis
**Performance Factors:** Booking count, utilization calculation complexity, date range filtering

### Scalability Considerations
**Concurrent Requests:** High concurrency support for equipment booking history viewing
**Resource Limitations:** Equipment with extensive booking histories may require pagination
