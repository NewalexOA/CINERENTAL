## Frontend Integration

### API Call Implementation

**Location:** `/frontend/static/js/equipment/equipment-timeline.js`
**Function/Method:** `loadEquipmentTimeline()`, `filterTimelineEvents()`, `refreshTimeline()`
**Call Pattern:** Promise-based GET request with pagination and filtering support

### Error Handling

#### Network Errors
**Detection:** Request timeouts during timeline loading
**User Feedback:** "Unable to load equipment timeline - check connection"
**Recovery:** Cached timeline data if available, retry mechanism

#### Server Errors
**Error Processing:** Equipment not found handled gracefully
**Error Display:** Timeline unavailable message with refresh option
**Error Recovery:** Alternative equipment selection, timeline refresh

### Loading States

**Loading Indicators:** Timeline loading skeleton, event loading spinners
**Expected Duration:** 300ms-1.5s depending on timeline complexity and date range
**Progress Indication:** Progressive loading for large timeline datasets

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times
**Typical Response Time:** 300ms-800ms for standard timelines, up to 2s for extensive equipment histories
**Performance Factors:** Timeline event count, date range filtering, related data loading

### Scalability Considerations
**Concurrent Requests:** High concurrency support for timeline viewing
**Resource Limitations:** Equipment with extensive histories may require pagination
