## Frontend Integration

### API Call Implementation

**Location:** `/frontend/static/js/equipment/equipment-status.js`
**Function/Method:** `updateEquipmentStatus()`, `bulkStatusUpdate()`, `maintenanceWorkflow()`
**Call Pattern:** Promise-based PUT request with status validation and conflict resolution

#### Request Building

**Parameter Assembly:** Equipment ID from component state, new status from form selection, maintenance details from workflow
**Data Validation:** Frontend validates status transitions, maintenance dates, condition ratings
**Header Construction:** Standard API headers with JWT authentication and content type

#### Response Processing

**Data Extraction:** Updated equipment status with affected booking information
**Data Transformation:** Status change history formatted, booking impact calculated
**State Updates:** Equipment status updated globally, affected bookings notified, timeline updated

### Error Handling

#### Network Errors

**Detection:** Connection timeouts, server unavailable, network interruption
**User Feedback:** "Unable to update status - check connection" with retry option
**Recovery:** Status change queued for retry, original status maintained until successful

#### Server Errors

**Error Processing:** Business logic conflicts parsed, valid transition options provided
**Error Display:** Status change conflict dialog with resolution options
**Error Recovery:** Alternative status options, booking conflict resolution workflow

#### Validation Errors

**Validation Feedback:** Status transition validation shown in status selection dropdown
**Field-Level Errors:** Maintenance date validation, condition rating constraints
**Error Correction:** Real-time validation with suggested corrections

### Loading States

#### Request Initialization

**Loading Indicators:** Status dropdown spinner, equipment row processing indicator
**User Interface Changes:** Status controls disabled during update, equipment locked from other operations
**User Restrictions:** Prevent concurrent status changes, block equipment editing during status update

#### Loading Duration

**Expected Duration:** 500ms-2s depending on booking impact analysis and notification processing
**Timeout Handling:** 30-second timeout with status preservation and error notification
**Progress Indication:** Multi-step progress for bulk status updates

## Data Flow Patterns

### Input Data Flow

**Data Sources:** Status selection dropdown, maintenance workflow forms, bulk operation selections
**Data Assembly:** Status change validated, maintenance scheduling processed, notification preferences applied
**Data Validation:** Business rule validation for status transitions, booking conflict checking

### Output Data Flow

**Response Processing:** Status change confirmed, affected bookings identified, impact assessment provided
**State Updates:** Equipment status globally updated, booking states refreshed, maintenance schedule updated
**UI Updates:** Status indicators updated, conflict resolution dialogs, booking notifications
**Data Persistence:** Status change logged in audit trail, equipment history updated

### Data Synchronization

**Cache Updates:** Equipment status updated in all cached instances, booking cache refreshed
**Related Data Updates:** Booking availability recalculated, maintenance schedule updated
**Optimistic Updates:** Status change applied optimistically with rollback on conflict

## API Usage Patterns

### Call Triggers

1. **Status Dropdown:** User selects new status from equipment status dropdown
2. **Maintenance Workflow:** Equipment progresses through maintenance workflow states
3. **Bulk Operations:** Multiple equipment status changes processed simultaneously
4. **Automated Updates:** System-triggered status changes based on booking completion
5. **Emergency Status:** Immediate status change due to equipment damage or failure

### Call Frequency

**Usage Patterns:** Moderate frequency during normal operations, high during maintenance periods
**Caching Strategy:** No caching for status updates, immediate state propagation required
**Rate Limiting:** Status changes throttled to prevent rapid status cycling

### Batch Operations

**Bulk Requests:** Multiple equipment status updates processed in parallel
**Transaction Patterns:** Status validation → booking impact analysis → status update → notification sending
**Dependency Chains:** Status change → booking validation → impact calculation → notification processing

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times

**Typical Response Time:** 500ms-1.5s for simple status changes, up to 5s with complex booking impacts
**Performance Factors:** Booking conflict analysis, notification processing, status validation complexity
**Performance Optimizations:** Async notification processing, cached booking validation

### Resource Usage

**Data Transfer:** 10-50KB including affected booking information and impact analysis
**Request Overhead:** Standard HTTP headers, authentication, status change payload
**Caching Benefits:** Booking validation cache reduces status change processing time

### Scalability Considerations

**Load Characteristics:** Moderate load due to booking impact analysis and notification processing
**Concurrent Requests:** Status change locking prevents concurrent modifications
**Resource Limitations:** Complex booking impact analysis may increase response times

## Integration Dependencies

### Prerequisite APIs

**Required Calls:** Equipment detail fetch to validate current status, booking check for conflict detection
**Data Dependencies:** Valid authentication, equipment status update permissions
**State Requirements:** Equipment must exist and user must have appropriate permissions

### Downstream Effects

**Dependent Operations:** Booking availability updates, maintenance scheduling, equipment reporting
**State Changes:** Equipment status globally updated, booking conflicts resolved, maintenance scheduled
**UI Updates:** Status indicators, booking lists, maintenance calendars, dashboard metrics

### Error Propagation

**Error Impact:** Status update failure prevents workflow progression, booking conflicts remain
**Error Recovery:** Status conflict resolution, alternative status selection, manual override options
**Fallback Strategies:** Scheduled status change, temporary status with automatic reversion

## Playwright Research Results

### API Monitoring Results

**Request Patterns:** Consistent PUT request structure with comprehensive status change data
