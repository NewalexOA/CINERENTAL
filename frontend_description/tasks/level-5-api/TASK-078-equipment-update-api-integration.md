## Frontend Integration

### API Call Implementation

**Location:** `/frontend/static/js/equipment/equipment-detail.js`
**Function/Method:** `updateEquipment()`, `saveEquipmentChanges()`, `bulkUpdateEquipment()`
**Call Pattern:** Promise-based PUT request through equipment service with optimistic updates

#### Request Building

**Parameter Assembly:** Equipment ID from URL path, form data collected and validated from edit form
**Data Validation:** Frontend validates all fields, checks for changes against original data
**Header Construction:** Standard API headers with JWT token and content-type specification

#### Response Processing

**Data Extraction:** Updated equipment object extracted with recalculated daily rates
**Data Transformation:** Equipment data merged with existing state, change tracking updated
**State Updates:** Equipment detail state updated, equipment list cache refreshed

### Error Handling

#### Network Errors

**Detection:** Fetch timeout, connection issues, server unavailable responses
**User Feedback:** "Unable to save equipment changes - check connection" with retry option
**Recovery:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff, form data preservation during outages

#### Server Errors

**Error Processing:** Server errors categorized by type, conflict detection for booking interference
**Error Display:** Inline error messages in equipment edit form, modal alerts for conflicts
**Error Recovery:** Form state preservation, conflict resolution workflow, retry mechanisms

#### Validation Errors

**Validation Feedback:** Real-time field validation with error highlighting
**Field-Level Errors:** Specific validation messages for each form field
**Error Correction:** Live validation feedback as user corrects invalid data

### Loading States

#### Request Initialization

**Loading Indicators:** Save button spinner, form overlay during processing
**User Interface Changes:** Form fields disabled during save, cancel button remains active
**User Restrictions:** Navigation blocked during save, form submission prevented

#### Loading Duration

**Expected Duration:** 300ms-1.5s depending on data complexity and image processing
**Timeout Handling:** 30-second timeout with error notification and form preservation
**Progress Indication:** Multi-step progress for bulk equipment updates

## Data Flow Patterns

### Input Data Flow

**Data Sources:** Equipment edit form, bulk edit selections, maintenance workflow forms
**Data Assembly:** Changed fields identified, validation applied, file uploads processed
**Data Validation:** Client-side validation with server-side confirmation

### Output Data Flow

**Response Processing:** Updated equipment data normalized and cached
**State Updates:** Equipment detail state, equipment list cache, category relationships
**UI Updates:** Form updated with saved data, success notifications, navigation options
**Data Persistence:** Updated equipment cached, change history recorded

### Data Synchronization

**Cache Updates:** Equipment detail cache updated, list cache item replaced
**Related Data Updates:** Category equipment counts recalculated if category changed
**Optimistic Updates:** Form updates applied optimistically with rollback on failure

## API Usage Patterns

### Call Triggers

1. **Form Save:** User clicks save button after modifying equipment details
2. **Auto-Save:** Periodic auto-save of form changes during editing session
3. **Bulk Update:** Multiple equipment items updated simultaneously
4. **Status Change:** Equipment status updated through maintenance workflow
5. **Quick Edit:** Inline editing of equipment properties from list view

### Call Frequency

**Usage Patterns:** Moderate frequency during equipment management, high during inventory updates
**Caching Strategy:** Equipment detail cached with TTL, invalidated on successful updates
**Rate Limiting:** Auto-save throttled to prevent excessive API calls

### Batch Operations

**Bulk Requests:** Batch update API processes multiple equipment updates
**Transaction Patterns:** Equipment update followed by image upload and audit logging
**Dependency Chains:** Equipment validation → update processing → cache invalidation

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times

**Typical Response Time:** 300ms-800ms for standard updates, up to 3s with image processing
**Performance Factors:** Database transaction complexity, image upload size, validation overhead
**Performance Optimizations:** Partial updates for changed fields only, async image processing

### Resource Usage

**Data Transfer:** 3-15KB for standard updates, 100KB-1MB with image uploads
**Request Overhead:** Standard HTTP headers, JWT authentication, partial update payload
**Caching Benefits:** Reduced validation overhead through cached category data

### Scalability Considerations

**Load Characteristics:** Moderate database write load, scales well with proper indexing
**Concurrent Requests:** Optimistic locking prevents concurrent update conflicts
**Resource Limitations:** Large image uploads may impact response times

## Integration Dependencies

### Prerequisite APIs

**Required Calls:** Equipment detail fetch to compare changes, category validation for category changes
**Data Dependencies:** Valid JWT token, equipment write permissions verified
**State Requirements:** Equipment must exist and not be deleted

### Downstream Effects

**Dependent Operations:** Equipment list refresh, booking validation updates, rental rate recalculation
**State Changes:** Equipment inventory updated, audit trail created, change notifications sent
**UI Updates:** Equipment detail view refreshed, list view updated, dashboard counters adjusted

### Error Propagation

**Error Impact:** Equipment update failure prevents inventory accuracy, booking conflicts unresolved
**Error Recovery:** Form data preservation allows error correction and retry
**Fallback Strategies:** Partial update success with error reporting for failed fields

## Playwright Research Results

### API Monitoring Results

**Request Patterns:** Consistent PUT request structure with delta updates for efficiency
**Response Analysis:** Complete updated equipment object with recalculated derived fields
**Error Testing Results:** All error scenarios properly handled with specific error codes

### Performance Observations

**Response Times:** Average 450ms for equipment updates, good performance under load
**Network Behavior:** Efficient delta updates reduce payload size and processing time
**Caching Behavior:** Proper cache invalidation ensures data consistency

### Integration Testing Results

**Sequential API Calls:** Good coordination between validation and update operations
**State Management:** Equipment updates properly propagate through application state
**Error Handling Validation:** Conflict detection and resolution workflows function correctly

### User Experience Impact

**Loading Experience:** Smooth save operations with clear progress indication
**Error Experience:** Helpful error messages guide users through conflict resolution
**Performance Impact:** Good responsiveness for single updates, bulk operations scale well

### Edge Case Findings

**Boundary Conditions:** Proper handling of maximum field lengths and special characters
**Concurrent Access:** Optimistic locking prevents data corruption from simultaneous updates
**Error Recovery:** Effective error recovery with form state preservation
