## Frontend Integration

### API Call Implementation

**Location:** `/frontend/static/js/booking/booking-status-manager.js`
**Function/Method:** `updateBookingStatus()`, `progressBookingWorkflow()`, `handleStatusTransition()`
**Call Pattern:** Promise-based PATCH request with workflow validation and state management

### Error Handling

#### Network Errors
**Detection:** Connection timeouts during status updates
**User Feedback:** "Unable to update booking status - check connection"
**Recovery:** Status change queued for retry, original status maintained

#### Server Errors
**Error Processing:** Invalid transitions guide user to valid options
**Error Display:** Status transition errors with workflow guidance
**Error Recovery:** Valid transition suggestions, workflow step clarification

### Loading States

**Loading Indicators:** Status update spinner, workflow progress indicator
**Expected Duration:** 500ms-2s depending on equipment updates and notifications
**Progress Indication:** Multi-step progress for complex status transitions

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times
**Typical Response Time:** 500ms-1.5s for simple status updates, up to 3s with equipment updates and notifications
**Performance Factors:** Equipment status validation, client notification processing, workflow calculation

### Scalability Considerations
**Concurrent Requests:** Status updates handled with booking state locking
**Resource Limitations:** Complex workflows with many equipment items may increase processing time
