## Implementation Notes

### Barcode System

- **Format:** 11-digit format (NNNNNNNNNCC) with checksum validation
- **Generation:** Auto-increment with leading zeros plus 2-digit checksum
- **Validation:** Real-time barcode format and checksum verification

### Equipment Status Workflow

- **Standard Cycle:** AVAILABLE → RENTED → AVAILABLE
- **Maintenance Cycle:** AVAILABLE → MAINTENANCE → AVAILABLE
- **Repair Cycle:** Any status → BROKEN → MAINTENANCE → AVAILABLE
- **End of Life:** Any status → RETIRED (soft deleted)

### Business Rules

- **Rental History Preservation:** Never hard-delete equipment or bookings
- **Equipment Uniqueness:** Serial numbers identify individual items
- **Quantity Support:** Non-serialized items support quantity management
- **Status Constraints:** Equipment can only be RENTED through active bookings

This architecture analysis provides the foundation for detailed page-level and component-level decomposition in subsequent stages.
