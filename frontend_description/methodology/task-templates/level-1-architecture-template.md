# LEVEL 1 TASK TEMPLATE: APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE

## üéØ TASK OBJECTIVE

**Goal:** Analyze the overall application architecture, main user flows, and global patterns.

**Focus:** FUNCTIONALITY, NOT DESIGN - describe what the application does, not how it looks.

## üìã TASK SPECIFICATION

### Input Data Required

- Complete pages inventory from `inventory/pages-inventory.json`
- Navigation structure from `/frontend/templates/base.html`
- Main JavaScript modules from `/frontend/static/js/`
- Application URLs and routing patterns

### Expected Analysis Areas

#### 1. Application Structure

- Main functional areas (equipment, projects, clients, bookings, etc.)
- User authentication and session management
- Global navigation patterns and menu structure
- Page relationships and workflows

#### 2. Core Functionality Patterns

- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Search and filtering mechanisms
- Pagination and data loading patterns
- Form validation and submission workflows

#### 3. Integration Points

- API endpoint patterns and conventions
- Data flow between pages
- State management approaches
- Error handling and notification systems

#### 4. User Workflows

- Primary user journeys (equipment rental process)
- Secondary workflows (client management, reporting)
- Administrative functions and settings

### üîç MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT RESEARCH

**CRITICAL:** Use MCP Playwright to interactively explore the application:

#### Research Steps

1. **Launch Application:**

   ```bash
   cd /Users/anaskin/Github/CINERENTAL && make dev
   # Open http://localhost:8000 in Playwright
   ```

2. **Navigate All Main Pages:**
   - Home (`/`) - capture main dashboard functionality
   - Equipment (`/equipment`) - explore catalog and management
   - Projects (`/projects`) - analyze project workflows
   - Clients (`/clients`) - study client management
   - Bookings (`/bookings`) - understand rental processes
   - Categories (`/categories`) - examine hierarchy management
   - Scanner (`/scanner`) - test barcode functionality

3. **Document User Flows:**
   - Record navigation paths between pages
   - Test primary actions (create, edit, search, filter)
   - Observe state changes and data loading
   - Take screenshots of key functional states

4. **API Pattern Analysis:**
   - Monitor Network tab during interactions
   - Document request/response patterns
   - Record error handling behaviors
   - Note loading states and indicators

### ‚ùå WHAT NOT TO DESCRIBE

**DO NOT focus on:**

- Visual design elements (colors, fonts, styling)
- Layout and positioning
- Bootstrap components and CSS classes
- Responsive behavior
- Animations or visual effects

### ‚úÖ WHAT TO DESCRIBE

**FOCUS ON:**

- Functional purpose of each page
- Data operations and business logic
- User interaction patterns
- API integration approaches
- Navigation and workflow patterns
- State management and error handling

## üìä EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT

Create file: `tasks/level-1-architecture/TASK-001-app-architecture.md`
