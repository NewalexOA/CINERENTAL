# LEVEL 2 TASK TEMPLATE: PAGE ANALYSIS

## üéØ TASK OBJECTIVE

**Goal:** Analyze a specific page's functionality, data operations, and user interactions.

**Focus:** FUNCTIONALITY, NOT DESIGN - describe what the page does, not how it looks.

## üìã TASK SPECIFICATION

### Input Data Required

- Page template file: `/frontend/templates/{page_name}.html`
- Associated JavaScript file: `/frontend/static/js/{page_name}.js`
- Page URL for Playwright testing: `http://localhost:8000/{page_path}`

### Expected Analysis Areas

#### 1. Page Purpose and Context

- Business purpose and target users
- Place in overall application workflow
- Dependencies on other pages/systems

#### 2. Data Operations

- What data is displayed and from where
- CRUD operations available on this page
- Data validation rules and constraints
- API endpoints used by this page

#### 3. User Interactions

- Available user actions (buttons, forms, links)
- Interactive elements and their behaviors
- Form submissions and data entry
- Navigation options to/from this page

#### 4. Functional States

- Loading states and data fetching
- Error states and error handling
- Empty states (no data scenarios)
- Success states and confirmations

### üîç MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT RESEARCH

**CRITICAL:** Use MCP Playwright to interactively explore the page:

#### Research Steps

1. **Page Access:**

   ```bash
   # Ensure application is running
   # Open {PAGE_URL} in Playwright browser
   ```

2. **Interactive Testing:**
   - Load the page and observe initial state
   - Test all clickable elements (buttons, links, tabs)
   - Fill out and submit any forms present
   - Use search/filter functionality if available
   - Test pagination or data loading if present

3. **State Documentation:**
   - Capture loading states and spinners
   - Trigger and document error scenarios
   - Test empty data states
   - Record success confirmations

4. **API Monitoring:**
   - Monitor Network tab during all interactions
   - Document all API calls made by the page
   - Record request parameters and response formats
   - Note error handling for failed requests

5. **User Flow Testing:**
   - Test complete user workflows on this page
   - Navigate to/from related pages
   - Test integration with other system components

### ‚ùå WHAT NOT TO DESCRIBE

**DO NOT focus on:**

- Page layout and visual structure
- Colors, fonts, and styling details
- Bootstrap component usage
- Responsive design behavior
- Visual animations or effects
- Exact positioning of elements

### ‚úÖ WHAT TO DESCRIBE

**FOCUS ON:**

- What business operations the page enables
- Data sources and destinations
- User actions and their results
- API integrations and data flow
- Validation rules and error handling
- Navigation patterns and workflow integration
