# LEVEL 3 TASK TEMPLATE: PAGE SECTION ANALYSIS

## üéØ TASK OBJECTIVE

**Goal:** Analyze a specific functional section within a page (e.g., search bar, data table, filter panel).

**Focus:** FUNCTIONALITY, NOT DESIGN - describe what the section does, not how it looks.

## üìã TASK SPECIFICATION

### Input Data Required

- Parent page context and URL
- Section location within page template
- Associated JavaScript functions
- Related API endpoints

### Expected Analysis Areas

#### 1. Section Purpose and Context

- Functional role within the parent page
- Business purpose and user needs served
- Dependencies on other page sections
- Integration with page-level operations

#### 2. Section Functionality

- Specific operations this section enables
- Data input/output mechanisms
- User interaction patterns
- State management within section

#### 3. Data Integration

- Data sources and API connections
- Data transformation and processing
- Validation rules and constraints
- Error handling and feedback

#### 4. User Experience Flow

- User interaction sequence
- Response patterns and feedback
- Integration with overall page workflow
- Edge cases and error scenarios

### üîç MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT RESEARCH

**CRITICAL:** Use MCP Playwright to interactively test the section:

#### Research Steps

1. **Section Location:**

   ```bash
   # Open {PARENT_PAGE_URL} in Playwright
   # Identify and interact specifically with the target section
   ```

2. **Functional Testing:**
   - Test all interactive elements within the section
   - Enter various types of data/input
   - Trigger all available actions and operations
   - Test validation rules and constraints

3. **State Observation:**
   - Document initial/default state
   - Observe loading and processing states
   - Trigger and document error states
   - Record success states and feedback

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test how section affects other page parts
   - Verify data flow to/from other sections
   - Test section behavior with various page states
   - Check integration with page-level operations

5. **API Monitoring:**
   - Monitor Network tab for section-specific calls
   - Document request parameters and timing
   - Test API error scenarios
   - Record response handling patterns

6. **Edge Case Testing:**
   - Test with empty/invalid data
   - Test rapid interactions and race conditions
   - Test section behavior with different user permissions
   - Test section during page state changes

### ‚ùå WHAT NOT TO DESCRIBE

**DO NOT focus on:**

- Visual styling and appearance
- Layout positioning within page
- CSS classes and Bootstrap components
- Colors, fonts, and design elements
- Responsive behavior and breakpoints
- Visual animations and transitions

### ‚úÖ WHAT TO DESCRIBE

**FOCUS ON:**

- What business operation the section enables
- User interactions and their outcomes
- Data processing and validation logic
- API integration and error handling
- State changes and feedback mechanisms
- Integration with other page sections
