## PROJECT CONTEXT

### About CINERENTAL Application

**CINERENTAL** is a cinematographic equipment rental management system. The application allows:

- Managing equipment catalog (cameras, lenses, lighting equipment)
- Creating filming projects and booking equipment
- Tracking rental and return statuses
- Scanning equipment barcodes
- Managing clients and their documents
- Printing documents and labels

**Users:** Equipment rental company employees (administrators, managers)

### Current Frontend State

**Technology Stack:**

- **Backend:** Python FastAPI (95% ready)
- **Frontend:** Jinja2 HTML templates + vanilla JavaScript + Bootstrap
- **Structure:** Server-side rendering with AJAX for dynamic elements

**File Structure:**

```text
/frontend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/           # Jinja2 HTML templates
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base.html       # Base template with navigation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ equipment/      # Equipment pages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/       # Project pages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clients/        # Client pages
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/             # JavaScript modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ css/            # Bootstrap + custom styles
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ img/            # Images and icons
```

**Main Application Pages:**

1. **Home** (`/`) - dashboard with statistics
2. **Equipment** (`/equipment`) - catalog with search and filters
3. **Projects** (`/projects`) - filming project management
4. **Clients** (`/clients`) - client database
5. **Bookings** (`/bookings`) - rental management
6. **Categories** (`/categories`) - equipment category hierarchy
7. **Scanner** (`/scanner`) - barcode scanning
8. **Modal Windows** - add/edit forms

### Why Frontend Migration is Needed

**Current Solution Problems:**

- Poor handling of dates and time ranges
- Complexity of maintaining and extending JavaScript code
- Lack of component approach (lots of duplication)
- Slow development of new features
- UX issues on mobile devices
- Difficulty testing frontend logic

**Target Solution:**

- Modern component framework (React/Vue/Next)
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern build and development tools
- Improved UX while maintaining familiar workflow

### Critical Requirements

**Preserving User Experience:**

- The application is actively used by company employees
- Users are accustomed to the current workflow and element placement
- Cannot radically change the working logic
- **Principle:** "Same UX, but better implemented"

**Functional Completeness:**

- 100% of current functionality must be recreated
- All API integrations must work identically
- All forms, filters, search must work the same way
- All print forms and documents must remain

## DECOMPOSITION PROBLEM

### Why Atomic Decomposition is Needed

**Quality Decomposition Principles:**

- Modern AI has large contexts (128K-200K+ tokens), but large context ‚â† quality result
- When analyzing the entire frontend (273 files), AI loses focus on details
- It's difficult to provide quality specifications for "entire equipment page" even with large context
- Independent tasks are needed for parallel work and better quality

**Atomic Approach Advantages:**

- Each task focuses on a specific element (‚â§15K tokens optimally)
- Possibility of parallel work by multiple agents
- Clear technical specification = quality result
- Ability to validate each component separately
- Better AI focus on specific problem, not attention diffusion

**Why exactly 10-15K tokens?**

- Modern AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet: 200K, GPT-4: 128K) can process much more
- But analysis quality decreases with too much information volume
- 10-15K tokens = optimal balance between detail and focus
- Sufficient for: HTML template + JS logic + Playwright research + documentation
- AI doesn't lose concentration on key details

### Technical Specification Requirements

**Each task for AI agent must contain:**

- Clear goal and context
- Specific input files for analysis
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected result format (JSON schema)
- Acceptance criteria

**Independence Principle:**

- Agent must understand the task WITHOUT studying all code
- All necessary data is specified in the task itself
- Task result doesn't depend on other incomplete tasks

### üö´ CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on functionality

**WHAT to describe in tasks:**

- ‚úÖ **Element purpose** - what it's for, what problem it solves
- ‚úÖ **Functionality** - what happens during interaction
- ‚úÖ **Data** - what data it displays, where it gets it from
- ‚úÖ **API integrations** - what requests it sends, with what parameters
- ‚úÖ **Behavior** - how it reacts to user actions
- ‚úÖ **States** - loading, error, success, empty states
- ‚úÖ **Validation** - what data verification rules
- ‚úÖ **Logic** - filtering, sorting, calculation algorithms

**WHAT NOT to describe in tasks:**

- ‚ùå **Visual design** - colors, fonts, sizes, margins
- ‚ùå **Element placement** - where it's located (top, bottom, left)
- ‚ùå **Appearance** - how tables, buttons, forms look
- ‚ùå **Styling** - CSS classes, Bootstrap components
- ‚ùå **Animations** - appearance effects, transitions
- ‚ùå **Responsive behavior** - how it behaves on different screens

**Correct Description Examples:**

‚úÖ **Correct:**

```text
Equipment search bar:
- Purpose: Search by name, description, barcode, serial number
- Behavior: Search launches after 3 characters with 300ms debounce
- API: GET /api/v1/equipment/search?q={query}
- States: idle, typing, loading, error
- Validation: minimum 3 characters
```

‚ùå **Incorrect:**

```text
Search bar:
- Located at the top of the page
- Has white background and gray border
- Has magnifying glass icon on the right
- Placeholder text is gray
- Border becomes blue on focus
```

**Principle:** Describe "WHAT it does", not "HOW it looks"

### üîç RESEARCH METHODOLOGY: Interactive Analysis with Playwright

**MANDATORY for all tasks level 2-4:** Use MCP Playwright for live application research.

**What to do with Playwright:**

- ‚úÖ **Open specific page** in browser
- ‚úÖ **Interact with elements** - click buttons, fill forms, use filters
- ‚úÖ **Track network requests** via DevTools (Network tab)
- ‚úÖ **Observe real-time behavior** - spinners, loading/error states
- ‚úÖ **Test various scenarios** - valid/invalid data, empty states
- ‚úÖ **Take screenshots of key states** for documentation
- ‚úÖ **Check JavaScript errors** in browser console

**Interactive Analysis Advantages:**

- **Real API calls:** See exact URLs, parameters, request headers
- **Actual behavior:** Not assumptions from code, but real operation
- **Hidden functionality:** Discover features not obvious from code
- **UI states:** All variants of loading, error, success, empty states
- **User Flow:** Understanding real user scenarios
- **Validation:** Which checks actually trigger

**Search Bar Research Example:**

```text
1. Open /equipment in browser
2. Find search bar, take screenshot
3. Enter 1 character ‚Üí record no request
4. Enter 3 characters ‚Üí see GET /api/v1/equipment/search in Network
5. Record request parameters, debounce time, spinner
6. Enter invalid characters ‚Üí check validation
7. Clear field ‚Üí record results reset
8. Test rapid typing ‚Üí ensure debounce
```

**Result:** Precise technical description based on real behavior

### Current Application Complexity (analysis examples)

To understand the task scale, consider complexity examples:

**Equipment page (`/equipment`):**

- Search bar with debounce and spinner
- Category filters (dropdown from API)
- Status filter (5 status variants)
- Table with 5 columns and action buttons
- Pagination top and bottom (3 page size variants)
- Equipment addition modal (7 fields with validation)
- Barcode printing modal (2 code types with preview)
- Scan session addition modal
- Integration with 6+ API endpoints

**JavaScript file `equipment-list.js`:**

- 1400+ lines of code
- 15+ functions for various operations
- API client with error handling
- Notification system
- Pagination logic
- Form handling and validation

**Projects page (`/projects`):**

- Dual-mode view (table + cards)
- Project name search
- Client filtering (loaded from API)
- Status filtering (4 variants)
- Period filtering (date range picker)
- Card grouping by status in Card View
- Collapsible sections for each status

**Common Modules:**

- Universal Cart System (equipment cart)
- Scanner Integration (barcode handling)
- Notification System (user notifications)
- Print Module (document and label printing)
- API Client (centralized HTTP client)
- Logger System (logging system)

**Scale Assessment:**

- ~273 files in frontend
- ~15-20 main JavaScript modules
- ~40+ API endpoints for integration
- ~10+ modal windows and forms
- ~150+ interactive UI elements

## Overall Project Goal

Create a system of atomic technical specifications for complete description of current CINERENTAL frontend application, to ensure precise recreation of functionality on modern technology (React/Vue/Next).

## Key Decomposition Principles

### 1. Task Atomicity

- Each task focuses on specific element (10-15K tokens optimally)
- One task = one specific component or function
- Independence: task can be completed without studying all code
- Quality over size: better detailed 12K token task than superficial 50K

### 2. Hierarchical Structure

```text
Level 1: Application Architecture (1 task)
Level 2: Pages (8-10 tasks)
Level 3: Page Sections (30-40 tasks)
Level 4: UI Components (80-120 tasks)
Level 5: API Integrations (40-60 tasks)
```

### 3. Specification Standardization

- Unified format for each level
- JSON result schemas
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Machine-readable output data

## File System Structure

```text
frontend_description/

## EXPECTED DECOMPOSITION RESULTS

### What we get after completing all stages

**1. Complete catalog of technical specifications (150+ tasks):**

```text
/tasks/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK-001-app-architecture.md           # Overall architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK-002-equipment-page-analysis.md    # Equipment page analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK-010-equipment-search-section.md   # Equipment search section
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK-025-search-input-component.md     # Search input component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TASK-087-equipment-search-api.md       # Equipment search API
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**2. JSON schemas for each level:**

- `architecture-schema.json` - entire application structure
- `page-schema.json` - page descriptions
- `section-schema.json` - section descriptions
- `component-schema.json` - UI component descriptions
- `api-schema.json` - API integration descriptions

**3. Dependency Map:**

- Component dependency map
- Implementation priorities
- Critical development path

### How to use results

**For Frontend Developer:**

1. Take level 4 task (component)
2. Read specification (5-10 minutes)
3. **Open page in Playwright** and interactively study component (15-20 minutes)
4. Analyze specified code files (10-15 minutes)
5. Create React/Vue component based on real behavior (30-60 minutes)
6. Write tests according to acceptance criteria

**For Product Owner:**

- Functionality completeness validation
- Sprint planning by priorities
- Original UX compliance control

**For QA:**

- Ready test cases from acceptance criteria
- Understanding expected behavior of each element
- Component-based regression testing

### Specification Usage Example

**TASK-025: Equipment Search Bar**

```text
Developer receives:

FUNCTIONALITY:
‚Üí Purpose (search by name, description, barcode)
‚Üí Behavior (300ms debounce, minimum 3 characters, loading spinner)
‚Üí API endpoint (/api/v1/equipment/search?q={query})
‚Üí Component states (idle, typing, loading, error, empty)
‚Üí Validation (minimum characters, special character handling)
‚Üí Events (onInput, onFocus, onClear)

PLAYWRIGHT RESEARCH:
‚Üí Open /equipment in browser
‚Üí Find search bar by ID #searchInput
‚Üí Test input of 1, 2, 3 characters
‚Üí Track Network requests in DevTools
‚Üí Record exact debounce time
‚Üí Check spinner and loading states
‚Üí Test invalid characters and clearing
‚Üí Take screenshots of key states

Does NOT receive:
‚úó How component looks
‚úó Where it's positioned
‚úó What colors and fonts it has

Result: Ready React component with precise behavior in 1-1.5 hours
```

### Advantages of This Approach

**Development Speed:**

- Parallel work of 5-10 developers
- Each takes independent task
- No need to study entire codebase

**Implementation Quality:**

- Detailed requirements based on real behavior eliminate misunderstanding
- Interactive research via Playwright ensures 100% description accuracy
- Acceptance criteria based on actual behavior, not assumptions
- JSON schemas enable automatic validation
- State screenshots serve as visual documentation

**Project Manageability:**

- Clear progress (completed N of M tasks)
- Ability to replan priorities
- Easy work distribution in team

**Documentation:**

- Complete technical description of entire frontend
- Knowledge base for new developers
- Foundation for future refactoring

## NEXT STEPS

### For New AI Agent

**STEP 1: Preparation**

1. Read this master plan completely (understand context)
2. Check working directory availability: `ls /Users/anaskin/Github/CINERENTAL/frontend_description/`
3. Launch application: `cd /Users/anaskin/Github/CINERENTAL && make dev`

**STEP 2: Entry Point Determination**

1. Read file `frontend_description/progress/status.json` (if exists)
2. If file doesn't exist - start with STAGE 1
3. If file exists - find first stage with status `"pending"`

**STEP 3: Stage Execution**

1. Follow selected stage instructions
2. Use Playwright for research (stages 2-6)
3. Create files according to structure

**STEP 4: Completion**

1. Update `status.json` - mark stage as `"completed"`
2. Create report `stage-N-report.md`
3. Prepare next stage
