## User Flow

### Equipment Selection and Booking Flow

1. User navigates to Equipment Catalog or Project Detail page
2. Performs equipment search using text search or barcode scanner
3. Reviews equipment details and availability calendar
4. Adds equipment to Universal Cart (embedded or floating mode)
5. Customizes quantity and date ranges per equipment item
6. Reviews cart contents and validates availability conflicts
7. Executes batch booking creation with client assignment
8. Receives confirmation with generated documents

### Project Management Flow

1. User accesses Project List with filtering options
2. Creates new project or selects existing project
3. Assigns client and sets project date ranges
4. Uses embedded Universal Cart to add equipment
5. Manages equipment quantities and custom date overrides
6. Tracks project status and equipment assignments
7. Generates project documents and handover materials

### Scanner-Based Equipment Processing

1. User accesses Scanner Interface or uses global scanner button
